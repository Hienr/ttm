INTRODUCTION

The name "Homer" brings before the mind a
definite picture of the blind minstrel, roaming from
city to citv and singing or chanting portions of the
great poems that are traditionally ascribed to him.
Such a type is splendidly represented by the bust of
Homer in the Naples Museum, and almost all that
tradition tells of the poet, save in so far as it is
made up of statements regarding his date — which
in turn rest upon combinations often demonstrably
false — groups itself about such a typical figure, and
is plainly without historic worth.

The ancient " lives " of Homer which have come
down to us are all later than the beginning of the
Christian era, and from them we can gather little
that has any claim to attention except the two
statements that Homer was an Ionian — Chios and
Smyrna being the cities most uniformly given as his
birthplace ; and that in Chios there was a guild or
clan of Homcridae — that is, "sons of Homer."
The first mention of the Chian Homeridae occurs
in the geographer Strabo (about 18 a.d.). Pindar

A 2 VU



INTRODUCTION

uses the term apparently of those devoted to
Homeric poetry without any reference to the Chian
clan, and the word is similarly used by Plato.

As for the name "Homer" itself it is most
naturally taken as that of a teal individual — a poet
to whom by the middle of the sixth century b.c.
the great mass of epic poetry which survived from
the early age of Greece had come to be attri-
buted ; although as time went on all poems save
the Iliad and Odyssey were rejected, and in later
antiquity there were those who referred these to
separate authors. The earliest author to mention
Homer is Callinus of Ephesus (about 660 b.c.) and
the earliest quotation from the Homeric poems is
found in Simonides of Amorgos, of the same date,
unless it is possibly to be attributed to the later
Simonides of Ceos (about 480 b.c). Modern scholars
have, however, made many attempts — all uncon-
vincing — to interpret the word " Homer " in other
ways than as the name of an actual person. The
word itself means "hostage." It has been thought
that the Homeridae may have been "sons of
hostages" — not trusted to fight but allowed to
serve as custodians of traditional poetry — and that
" Homer " is merely their imaginary ancestor ;
others, seeking a different etymology for the word,

viii



INTRODUCTION

have held that it denotes merely the legendary
fitter-together or harmonizer (6/xrj + ap) of tradi-
tional poetical material. That the word means
" hlind " was assumed in antiquity, but is believed
by no one.

If the personality of the poet, under whose name
the Odyssey has come down to us, is thus vague
and shadowy — even the most familiar elements
being drawn perhaps from his own portrayal of the
blind bard, Demodocus — so too there has seemed
to many scholars to be a like obscurity regarding
the early history of the poem itself. Regarding
this the evidence is as follows :

The oldest manuscripts of the Odyssey date from
the tenth and eleventh centuries a.d. Papyrus
fragments whose dates range from the third cen-
tury b.c. to the fourth century a.d. carry our know-
ledge still further back, and the evidence afforded
by our acquaintance with the work of the Alexan-
drian grammarians is invaluable in tracing the
history of the text ; while, finally, we have quota-
tions from Homer in classical authors, and some-
what vague and not wholly convincing evidence of
the constitution of an authoritative text at Athens
in the sixth century b.c. Certain facts stand out
prominently. First, our modern text is remarkably

ir



INTRODUCTION

well established — far better established than is, for
example, the text of Shakespeare. Secondly, this
text seems to have been fixed as the result of a
purging or pruning process. We know, for example,
that the critical work of the Alexandrians was con-
cerned largely with the rejection of lines held on
one ground or another to be spurious, that the text
of the papyri differs widely from our vulgate text,
and that the quotations in ancient authors show
many lines not found in our Homer.

From this evidence the conclusion has been drawn
that in antiquity " Homer " meant the whole mass
of epic poetry — for this there is definite evidence —
and that our Iliad and Odyssey, both as regards text
and content, were in a more or less fluid state until
they gradually crystallized into the forms familiar
to us. On this view it is impossible to speak of a
poet, Homer, as the author either of Iliad or Odyssey.
It should be stated, however, that while much of
modern Homeric criticism has been analytic and
destructive, in many important respects recent
studies have shown that both the methods and the
results of destructive criticism are misleading, and
have given stronger and more convincing grounds
for a belief in the essential integrity of both poems,
each as the work of one supreme artist.



INTRODUCTION

The most notable Homeric critics of antiquity
were Zenodotus of Ephesus, librarian of the great
library at Alexandria under Ptolemy Philadelphus
(who reigned 285-247 b.c), Aristophanes of By-
zantium, a pupil of Zenodotus, and like him, librarian
at Alexandria (about 200 B.C.), and Aristarchus of
Samothrace, pupil of Aristophanes and his successor
as librarian (about 160 B.C.). Other scholars cited
in the critical notes are Rhianus (about 225 b c.\
the poet, Onomacritus (about 550 B.C.), and Callis-
tratus, a follower of Aristophanes.

The aim of the translator has been to give a
faithful rendering of the Odyssey that preserves in
so far as possible certain traits of the style of the
original. Such a rendering should be smooth and
flowing and should be given in elevated but not
in stilted language. In particular the recurrent
lines and phrases which are so noticeable in the
original should be preserved. Hence even when
in a given context a varying phrase would seem
preferable, the translator has felt bound to use the
traditional formula. This has in some instances
necessitated the use of a more or less colourless
phrase, adapted to various contexts. In the case of
doubtful renderings, alternatives are sometimes
given in a footnote.

INTRODUCTION

The Greek text of this edition is in all essentials
the modern vulgate. The notes under the text
give occasionally the name of- the ancient critic
whose reading is adopted and note the lines re-
jected by the Alexandrians. Variants, if cited, are
marked off by colons.

THE ODYSSEY



BOOK I

Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many devices,
who wandered full many ways after he had sacked
the sacred citadel of Troy. Many were the men
whose cities he saw and whose mind he learned, aye,
and many the woes he suffered in his heart upon the
sea, seeking to win his own life and the return of
his comrades. Yet even so he saved not his com-
rades, though he desired it sore, for through their
own blind folly they perished — fools, who devoured
the kine of Helios Hyperion ; but he took from them
the day of their returning. Of these things, goddess,
daughter of Zeus, beginning where thou wilt, tell
thou even unto us.

Now all the rest, as many as had escaped sheer
destruction, were at home, safe from both war and
sea, but Odysseus alone, filled with longing for his
return and for his wife, did the queenly nymph Ca-
lypso, that bright goddess, keep back in her hollow
caves, yearning that he should be her husband. But
when, as the seasons revolved, the year came in
which the gods had ordained that he should return
home to Ithaca, not even there was he free from
toils, even among his own folk. And all the gods

pitied him save Poseidon ; but he continued to rage
unceasingly against godlike Odysseus until at length
he reached his own laud.

Howbeit Poseidon had gone among the far-off
Ethiopians — the Ethiopians who dwell sundered in
twain, the farthermost of men, some where Hyperion
sets and some where he rises, there to receive a heca-
tomb of bulls and rams, and there he was taking his
joy, sitting at the feast; but the other gods were
gathered together in the halls of Olympian Zeus.
Among them the father of gods and men was first to
speak, for in his heart he thought of noble Aegis-
thus, whom far-famed Orestes, Agamemnon's son,
had slain. Thinking on him he spoke among the
immortals, and said :

" Look you now, how ready mortals are to blame
the gods. It is from us, they say, that evils come,
but they even of themselves, through their own
blind folly, have sorrows beyond that which is or-
dained. Even as now Aegisthus, beyond that which
was ordained, took to himself the wedded wife of
the son of Atreus, and slew him on his return,
though well he knew of sheer destruction, seeing
that we spake to him before, sending Hermes, the
keen-sighted Argeiphontes, 1 that he should neither
slay the man nor woo his wife ; for from Orestes
shall come vengeance for the son of Atreus when
once he has come to manhood and longs for his own
land. So Hermes spoke, but for all his good intent
he prevailed not upon the heart of Aegisthus; and
now he has paid the full price of all."

"the swift appearer" (root <pav). The rendering "slayer of
Argus" (root <pfv) is inadmissible, as there is no trace of
the Argus-myth in Homer.

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed 1 Athene, answered
him: "Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high
above all lords, aye, verily that man lies low in a
destruction that is his due ; so, too, may any other
also be destroyed who does such deeds. But my
heart is torn for wise Odysseus, hapless man, who
far from his friends has long been suffering woes in
a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea. 'Tis
a wooded isle, and therein dwells a goddess, daughter
of Atlas of baneful mind, who knows the depths of
every sea, and himself holds 1;he tall pillars which
keep earth and heaven apart. His daughter it is
that keeps back that wretched, sorrowing man ; and
ever with soft and wheedling words she beguiles
him that he may forget Ithaca. But Odysseus, in
his longing to see were it but the smoke leaping up
from his own land, yearns to die. Yet thy heart
doth not regard it, Olympian. Did not Odysseus
beside the ships of the Argives offer thee sacrifice
without stint in the broad land of Troy ? Wherefore
then didst thou conceive such wrath 2 against him,
O Zeus?"

Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her and
said : " My child, what a word has escaped the barrier
of thy teeth ? How should I, then, forget godlike
Odysseus, who is beyond all mortals in wisdom, and
beyond all has paid sacrifice to the immortal gods,
who hold broad heaven ? Nay, it is Poseidon, the
earth-enfolder, who is ever filled with stubborn wrath
because of the Cyclops, whom Odysseus blinded of

of wrath." Bee xix. 409.

his eye — even the godlike Polyphemus, whose might
is greatest among all the Cyclopes ; and the nymph
Tlioosa bore him, daughter of Phorcys who rules
over the unresting 1 sea ; for in the hollow caves she
lay with Poseidon. From that time forth Poseidon,
the earth-shaker, does not indeed slay Odysseus, but
makes him a wanderer from his native land. But
come, let us who are here all take thought of his
return, that he may come home ; and Poseidon will
let go his anger, for he will in no wise be able,
against all the immortal gods and in their despite,
to contend alone."

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, answered
him : " Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high
above all lords, if indeed this is now well pleasing
to the blessed gods, that the wise Odysseus should
return to his own home, let us send forth Hermes,
the messenger, Argeiphontes, to the isle Ogygia,
that with all speed lie may declare to the fair-tressed
nymph our fixed resolve, even the return of Odys-
seus of the steadfast heart, that he may come home.
But, as for me, I will go to Ithaca, that I may the
more arouse his son, and set courage in his heart to
call to an assembly the long-haired Achaeans, and
speak out his word to all the wooers, who are ever
slaying his thronging sheep and his sleek 2 kine of
shambling gait. And I will guide him to Sparta and
to sandy Pylos, to seek tidings of the return of his
dear father, if haply he may hear of it, that good
report may be his among men."

* f\tKas is a word of uncertain etymology. The rendering
given above connects it with jf\as. Others understand it as
referring to the "crumpled" horns of cattle, or treat it as
virtually equivalent to ti\Lno8as. The ancients took the
word to mean "black."

over the boundless land swift as the blasts of the
wind. And she took her mighty spear, tipped with
sharp bronze, heavy and huge and strong, wherewith
she vanquishes the ranks of men — of warriors, with
whom she is wroth, she, the daughter of the mighty
sire. Then she went darting down from the heights
of Olympus, and took her stand in the land of
Ithaca at the outer gate of Odysseus, on the thresh-
old of the court. In her hand she held the spear
of bronze, and she was in the likeness of a stranger,
Mentes, the leader of the Taphians. There she
found the proud wooers. They were taking their
pleasure at draughts in front of the doors, sitting on
the hides of oxen which they themselves had slain ;
and of the heralds 2 and busy squires, some were
mixing wine and water for them in bowls, others
again were washing the tables with porous sponges
and setting them forth, while still others were por-
tioning out meats in abundance.

Her the godlike Telemachus was far the first to
see, for he was sitting among the wooers, sad at
heart, seeing in thought his noble father, should he
perchance come from somewhere and make a scat-
tering of the wooers in the palace, and himself win
honour and rule over his own house. As he thought
of these things, sitting among the wooers, he beheld
Athene, and he went straight to the outer door ; for
in his heart he counted it shame that a stranger

1 It has seemed better to render the word Kv}pi/| uniformly
by "herald," although the meanings range from "herald"
in battle scenes to " page " or "henchman" in scenes por-
traying life in the palace.

should stand long at the gates. So, drawing near,
he clasped her right hand, and took from her the
spear of bronze ; and he spoke, and addressed her
with winged words : *

"Hail, stranger; in our house thou shalt find enter-
tainment, and then, when thou hast tasted food, thou
shalt tell of what thou hast need."

So saying, he led the way, and Pallas Athene fol-
lowed. And when they were within the lofty house,
he bore the spear and set it against a tall pillar in a
polished spear-rack, where were set many spears
besides, even those of Odysseus of the steadfast
heai-t. Athene herself he led and seated on a chair,
spreading a linen cloth beneath — a beautiful chair,
richly-wrought, 2 and below was a footstool for the
feet. Beside it he placed for himself an inlaid seat,
apart from the others, the wooers, lest the stranger,
vexed by their din, should loathe the meal, seeing
that he was in the company of overweening men ;
and also that he might ask him about his father that
was gone. Then a handmaid brought water for the
hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a
silver basin for them to wash, and beside them drew
up a polished table. And the grave housewife
brought and set before them bread, and therewith
dainties in abundance, giving freely of her store.
And a carver lifted up and placed before them
platters of all manner of meats, and set by them
golden goblets, while a herald ever walked to and
fro pouring them wine.

Then in came the proud wooers, and thereafter
sat them down in rows on chairs and high seats.
Heralds poured water over their hands, and maid-

servants heaped by them bread in baskets, and youths
filled the bowls brim full of drink ; and they put
forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready
before them. Now after the wooers had put from
them the desire of food and drink, their hearts
turned to other things, to song and to dance ; for
these things are the crown of a feast. And a herald
put the beautiful lyre in the hands of Phemius, who
sang perforce among the wooers ; and he struck the
chords in prelude 1 to his sweet lay.

But Telemachus spoke to flashing-eyed Athene,
holding his head close, that the others might not
hear : " Dear stranger, wilt thou be wroth with me
for the word that I shall say ? These men care for
things like these, the lyre and song, full easily, seeing
that without atonement they devour the livelihood
of another, of a man whose white bones, it may be,
rot in the rain as they lie upon the mainland, or the
wave rolls them in the sea. Were they to see him
returned to Ithaca, they w r ould all pray to be swifter
of foot, rather than richer in gold and in raiment.
But now he has thus perished by an evil doom, nor
for us is there any comfort, no, not though any one
of men upon the earth should say that he will come ;
gone is the day of his returning. But come, tell me
this, and declare it truly. Who art thou among
men, and from whence ? Where is thy city and
where thy parents? On what manner of ship didst
thou come, and how did sailors bring thee to Ithaca?
Who did they declare themselves to be ? For nowise,
methinks, didst thou come hither on foot. And tell
me this also truly, that I may know full well, whether
this is thy first coming hither, or whether thou art

the chords, and lifted up bia voice in sweet song."

indeed a friend of my father's house. For many
were the men who came to our house as strangers,
since he, too, had gone to and fro 1 among men."

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, answered
him: "Therefore of a truth will I frankly tell thee
all. I declare that I am Mentes, the son of wise
Anchialus, and I am lord over the oar-loving Taphians.
And now have I put in here, as thou seest, with ship
and crew, while sailing over the wine-dark sea to men
of strange speech, on my way to Temese for copper;
and I bear with me shining iron. My ship lies yonder
beside the fields away from the city, in the harbour
of Rheithron, under woody Neion. Friends of one
another do we declare ourselves to be, even as our
fathers were, friends from of old. Nay, if thou wilt,
go and ask the old warrior Laertes, who, they say,
comes no more to the city, but afar in the fields suffers
woes attended by an aged woman as his handmaid,
who sets before him food and drink, after weariness
has laid hold of his limbs, as he creeps along the
slope of his vineyard plot. And now am I come,
for of a truth men said that he, thy father, was
among his people ; but lo, the gods are thwarting
him of his return. For not yet has goodly Odysseus
perished on the earth, but still, I ween, he lives and
is held back on the broad sea in a sea-girt isle, and
cruel men keep him, a savage folk, that constrain
him, haply sore against his will. Nay, I will now
prophesy to thee, as the immortals put it in my heart,
and as I think it shall be brought to pass, though I
am in no wise a soothsayer, nor one versed in the

signs of birds. Not much longer shall he be absent
from his dear native land, no, not though bonds of
iron hold him. He will contrive a way to return,
for he is a man of many devices. But come, tell me
this and declare it truly, whether indeed, tall as
thou art, thou art the son of Odysseus himself.
Wondrously like his are thy head and beautiful
eyes ; for full often did we consort with one an-
other before he embarked for the land of Troy,
whither others, too, the bravest of the Argives, went
in their hollow ships. But since that day neither
have I seen Odysseus, nor he me."

Then wise Telemachus answered her: "Therefore
of a truth, stranger, will I frankly tell thee all. My
mother says that I am his child ; but I know not,
for never yet did any man of himself know his own
parentage. Ah, would that I had been the son of
some blest man, whom old age overtook among his
own possessions. But now of him who was the most
ill-fated of mortal men they say that I am sprung,
since thou askest me of this."

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, answered
him : " Surely, then, no nameless lineage have the
gods appointed for thee in time to come, seeing that
Penelope bore thee such as thou art. But come,
tell me this and declare it truly. What feast, what
throng: is this ? What need hast thou of it ? Is it
a drinking bout, or a wedding feast ? For this plainly
is no meal to which each brings his portion, with
such outrage and overweening do they seem to me
to be feasting in thy halls. Angered would a man
be at seeing all these shameful acts, any man of
sense who should come among them."

Then wise Telemachus answered her: "Stranger,

since indeed thou dost ask and question me of this,
our house once bade fair to be rich and honourable,
so long as that man was still among his people. But
now the gods have willed otherwise in their evil
devising, seeing that they have caused him to pass
from sight as they have no other man. For I should
not so grieve for his death, if he had been slain
among his comrades in the land of the Trojans, or
had died in the arms of his friends, when he had
wound up the skein of war. Then would the whole
host of the Achaeans have made him a tomb, and
for his son, too, he would have won great glory in
days to come. But as it is, the spirits of the storm 1
have swept him away and left no tidings : he is gone
out of sight, out of hearing, and for me he has left
anguish and weeping ; nor do I in any wise mourn
and wail for him alone, seeing that the gods have
brought upon me other sore troubles. For all the
princes who hold sway over the islands — Dulichium
and Same and wooded Zacynthus — and those who
lord it over rocky Ithaca, all these woo my mother
and lay waste my house. And she neither refuses
the hateful marriage, nor is she able to make an
end ; but they with feasting consume my substance :
ere long they will bring me, too, to ruin."

Then, stirred to anger, Pallas Athene spoke to him:
"Out on it! Thou hast of a truth sore need of
Odysseus that is gone, that he might put forth his
hands upon the shameless wooers. Would that he
might come now and take his stand at the outer gate
of the house, with helmet and shield and two spears,

1 The apirvtai, or " snatchers," are in Homer personified
storm-winds; see xiv. 371; xx. 61-82; and Iliad, vi. 346.

such a man as he was when I first saw him in our
house drinking and making merry, on his way back
from Ephyre, from the house of Uus, son of Mermerus.
For thither, too, went Odysseus in his swift ship in
search of a deadly drug, that he might have where-
with to smear his bronze-tipped arrows ; yet Ilus
gave it not to him, for he stood in awe of the gods
that are forever ; but my father gave it, for he held
him strangely dear. Would, I say, that in such
strength Odysseus might come amongst the wooers ;
then should they all find swift destruction and bit-
terness in their wooing. Yet these things verily lie
on the knees of the gods, whether he shall return
and wreak vengeance in his halls, or whether he
shall not ; but for thyself, I bid thee take thought
how thou mayest thrust forth the wooers from the
hall. Come now, give ear, and hearken to my words.
On the morrow call to an assembly the Achaean
lords, and speak out thy word to all, and let the gods
be thy witnesses. As for the wooers, bid them scatter,
each to his own ; and for thy mother, if her heart
bids her marry, let her go back to the hall of her
mighty father, and there they will prepare a wedding
feast, and make ready the gifts 1 full many — aye, all
that should follow after a well-loved daughter. And
to thyself will I give wise counsel, if thou wilt
hearken. Man with twenty rowers the best ship
thou hast, and go to seek tidings of thy father, that
has long been gone, if haply any mortal may tell

but we must still think of the gifts as brought by the wooers,
even though they were subsequently given to the bride by
her parents. Owing to this difficulty many scholars reject
line 278 (and ii. 197), and take ol 5« of the wooers, not of the
kinsfolk of Penelope.

thee, or thou mayest hear a voice from Zeus, which
oftenest brings tidings to men. First go to Pylos
and question goodly Nestor, and from thence to
Sparta to fair-haired Menelaus ; for he was the last
to reach home of the brazen-coated Achaeans. If
so be thou shalt hear that thy father is alive and
coming home, then verily, though thou art sore af-
flicted, thou couldst endure for yet a year. But if
thou shalt hear that he is dead and gone, then return
to thy dear native land and heap up a mound for
him, and over it pay funeral rites, full many as is
due, and give thy mother to a husband. Then when
thou hast done all this and brought it to an end,
thereafter take thought in mind and heart how thou
mayest slay the wooers in thy halls whether by guile
or openly ; for it beseems thee not to practise childish
ways, since thou art no longer of such an age. Or
hast thou not heard what fame the goodly Orestes
won among all mankind when he slew his father's
murderer, the guileful Aegisthus, for that he slew
his glorious father? Thou too, my friend, for I see
that thou art comely and tall, be thou valiant, that
many an one of men yet to be born may praise thee.
But now I will go down to my swift ship and my
comrades, who, methinks, are chafing much at waiting
for me. For thyself, give heed and have regard to
my words."

Then wise Telemachus answered her: "Stranger,
in truth thou speakest these things with kindly
thought, as a father to his son, and never will I
forget them. But come now, tarry, eager though
thou art to be gone, in order that when thou hast
bathed and satisfied thy heart to the full, thou mayest
go to thy ship glad in spirit, and bearing a gift costly

and very beautiful, which shall be to thee an heir-
loom from me, even such a gift as dear friends give
to friends."

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, answered
him : "Stay me now no longer, when I am eager to
be gone, and whatsoever gift thy heart bids thee
give me, give it when I come back, to bear to my
home, choosing a right beautiful one ; it shall bring
thee its worth in return."

So spoke the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, and
departed, flying upward 1 as a bird ; and in his heart
she put strength and courage, and made him think
of his father even more than aforetime. And in his
mind he marked her and marvelled, for he deemed
that she was a god ; and straightway he went among
the wooers, a godlike man.

For them the famous minstrel was singing, and
they sat in silence listening ; and he sang of the
return of the Achaeans — the woeful return from
Troy which Pallas Athene laid upon them. And
from her upper chamber the daughter of Icarius,
wise Penelope, heard his wondrous song, and she
went down the high stairway from her chamber, not
alone, for two handmaids attended her. Now when
the fair lady had come to the wooers, she stood by
the doorpost of the well-built hall, holding before
her face her shining veil ; and a faithful handmaid
stood on either side of her. Then she burst into
tears, and spoke to the divine minstrel :

" Phemius, many other things thou knowest to
charm mortals, deeds of men and gods which min-

to be the name of a bird. Others give it the meaning
"invisibly," and still others render "through the openings
(o7ra() in the roof."

strels make famous. Sing them one of these, as
thou sittest here, and let them drink their wine in
silence. But cease from this woeful song which ever
harrows the heart in my breast, for upon me above
all women has come a sorrow not to be forgotten.
So dear a head do I ever remember with longing,
even my husband, whose fame is wide through Hellas
and mid-Argos." x

Then wise Telemachus answered her: "My mother,
why dost thou begrudge the good minstrel to give
pleasure in whatever way his heart is moved ? It is
not minstrels that are to blame, but Zeus, I ween,
is to blame, who gives to men that live by toil, 2 to
each one as he will. With this man no one can be
wroth if he sings of the evil doom of the Danaans ;
for men praise that song the most which comes the
newest to their ears. For thyself, let thy heart and
soul endure to listen ; for not Odysseus alone lost in
Troy the day of his return, but many others likewise
perished. Nay, go to thy chamber, and busy thyself
with thine own tasks, the loom and the distaff, and
bid thy handmaids ply their tasks ; but speech shall
be for men, for all, but most of all for me; since
mine is the authority in the house."

She then, seized with wonder, went back to her
chamber, for she laid to heart the wise saying of her
son. Up to her upper chamber she went with her
handmaids, and then bewailed Odysseus, her dear
husband, until flashing-eyed Athene cast sweet sleep
upon her eyelids.

1 The phrase probably means no more than " throughout
the length and breadth of Greece."

2 Others render "that live by bread," and still others
" gain-getting."

But the wooers broke into uproar throughout the
shadowy halls, and all prayed, each that he might lie
by her side. And among them wise Telemachus was
the first to speak :

"Wooers of my mother, overweening in your in-
solence, for the present let us make merry with
feasting, but let there be no brawling ; for this is a
goodly thing, to listen to a minstrel such as this man
is, like to the gods in voice.- But in the morning let
us go to the assembly and take our seats, one and all,
that I may declare my word to you outright that you
depart from these halls. Prepare you other feasts,
eating your own substance and changing from house
to house. But if this seems in your eyes to be a
better and more profitable thing, that one man's live-
lihood should be ruined without atonement, waste ye
it. But I will call upon the gods that are forever,
if haply Zeus may grant that deeds of requital may
be wrought. Without atonement, then, should ye
perish within my halls."

So he spoke, and they all bit their lips and mar-
velled at Telemachus, for that he spoke boldly.

Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him:
"Telemachus, verily the gods themselves are teaching
thee to be a man of vaunting tongue, and to speak
with boldness. May the son of Cronos never make
thee king in sea-girt Ithaca, which thing is by birth
thy heritage."

Then wise Telemachus answered him : " Antinous,
wilt thou be wroth with me for the word that I shall
say? Even this should I be glad to accept from the
hand of Zeus. Thinkest thou indeed that this is the
worst fate among men ? Nay, it is no bad thing to
be a king. Straightway one's house grows rich and

oneself is held in greater honour. However, there
are other kings of the Achaeans full many in sea-
girt Ithaca, both young and old. One of these haply
may have this place, since goodly Odysseus is dead.
But I will be lord of our own house and of the slaves
that goodly Odysseus won for me."

Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him :
" Telemachus, this matter verily lies on the knees of
the gods, who of the Achaeans shall be king in sea-
girt Ithaca ; but as for thy possessions, thou mayest
keep them thyself, and be lord in thine own house.
Never may that man come who by violence and
against thy will shall wrest thy possessions from
thee, while men yet live in Ithaca. But I am fain,
good sir, to ask thee of the stranger, whence this
man comes. Of what land does he declare himself
to be ? Where are his kinsmen and his native
fields ? Does he bring some tidings of thy father's
coming, or came he hither in furtherance of some
matter of his own ? How he started up, and was
straightway gone ! Nor did he wait to be known ;
and yet he seemed no base man to look upon."

Then wise Telemachus answered him : "Eury-
machus, surely my father's home-coming is lost and
gone. No longer do I put trust in tidings, whence-
soever they may come, nor reck I of any prophecy
which my mother haply may learn of a seer, when
she has called him to the hall. But this stranger is
a friend of my father's house from Taphos. He
declares that he is Mentes, son of wise Anchialus,
and he is lord over the oar-loving Taphians."

So spoke Telemachus, but in his heart he knew
the immortal goddess.

Now the wooers turned to the dance and to glad-

some song, and made them merry, and waited till
evening should come ; and as they made merry dark
evening came upon them. Then they went, each
man to his house, to take their rest. But Telemachus,
where his chamber was built in the beautiful court,
high, in a place of wide outlook, thither went to his
bed, pondering many things in mind ; and with him,
bearing blazing toi-ches, went true-hearted Eurycleia,
daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor. Her long ago
Laertes had bought with his wealth, when she was
in her first youth, and gave for her the price of
twenty oxen ; and he honoured her even as he
honoured his faithful wife in his halls, but he never
lay with her in love, for he shunned the wrath of
his wife. She it was who bore for Telemachus the
blazing torches ; for she of all the handmaids loved
him most, and had nursed him when he was a child.
He opened the doors of the well-built chamber, sat
down on the bed, and took off his soft tunic and laid
it in the wise old woman's hands. And she folded
and smoothed the tunic and hung it on a peg beside
the corded 1 bedstead, and then went forth from the
chamber, drawing the door to by its silver handle,
and driving the bolt home with the thong. So there,
the night through, wrapped in a fleece of wool, he
pondered in his mind upon the journey which Athene
had shewn him.

BOOK II



Soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,
up from his bed arose the dear son of Odysseus and
put on his clothing. About his shoulder he slung
his sharp sword, and beneath his shining feet bound
his fair sandals, and went forth from his chamber
like a god to look upon. Straightway he bade the
clear-voiced heralds to summon to the assembly the
longr-haired Achaeans. And the heralds made the
summons, and the Achaeans assembled full quickly.
Now when they were assembled and met together,
Telemachus went his way to the place of assembly,
holding in his hand a spear of bronze — not alone,
for along with him two swift hounds followed; and
wondrous was the grace that Athene shed upon him,
and all the people marvelled at him as he came. But
he sat down in his father's seat, and the elders gave
place.

Then among them the lord Aegyptius was the
first to speak, a man bowed with age and wise with
wisdom untold. Now he spoke, because his dear son
had gone in the hollow ships to Ilius, famed for its
horses, in the company of godlike Odysseus, even
the warrior Antiphus. But him the savage Cyclops
had slain in his hollow cave, and made of him his
latest meal. Three others there were ; one, Eury-
noraus, consorted with the wooers, and two ever kept

their father's farm. Yet, even so, he could not forget
that other, mourning and sorrowing; and weeping
for him he addressed the assembly, and spoke among
them :

" Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca, to the word
that I shall say. Never have we held assembly or
session since the day when goodly Odysseus departed
in the hollow ships. And now who has called us
together ? On whom has such need come either of
the young men or of those who are older ? Has he
heard some tidings of the army's return, 1 which he
might tell us plainly, seeing that he has first learned
of it himself? Or is there some other public matter
on which he is to speak and address us ? A good
man he seems in my eyes, a blessed man. May Zeus
fulfil unto him himself some good, even whatsoever
he desires in his heart."

So he spoke, and the dear son of Odysseus re-
joiced at the word of omen ; nor did he thereafter
remain seated, but was fain to speak. So he took
his stand in the midst of the assembly, and the staff
was placed in his hands by the herald Peisenor, wise
in counsel. Then he spoke, addressing first the old
man :

" Old man, not far off, as thou shalt soon learn thy-
self, is that man who has called the host together —
even I ; for on me above all others has sorrow come.
I have neither heard any tidings of the army's re-
turn, which I might tell you plainly, seeing that I
had first learned of it myself, nor is there any other
public matter on which I am to speak and address
you. Nay, it is mine own need, for that evil has
fallen upon my house in two-fold wise. First, I have
lost my noble sire who was once king among you

1 Or, possibly, "regarding an invading host."

here, and was gentle as a father ; and now there is
come an evil yet greater far, which will presently
altogether destroy my house and ruin all my liveli-
hood. My mother have wooers beset against her will,
the sons of those men who .are here the noblest.
They shrink from going to the house of her father,
Icarius, that he may himself exact the bride-gifts for
his daughter, and give her to whom he will, even
to him who meets his favour, but thronging our
house day after day they slay our oxen and sheep
and fat goats, and keep revel, and drink the flaming
wine recklessly ; and havoc is made of all this wealth.
For there is no man here, such as Odysseus was, to
ward off ruin from the house. As for me, I am no wise
such as he to ward it off. Nay verily, even if I try I
shall be found a weakling and one knowing naught of
valour. Yet truly I would defend myself, if I had
but the power ; for now deeds past all enduring have
been wrought, and past all that is seemly has my
house been destroyed. Take shame upon yourselves,
and have regard to your neighbours who dwell round
about, and fear the wrath of the gods, lest haply
they turn against you in anger at your evil deeds. 1 I
pray you by Olympian Zeus, and by Themis who
looses and gathers the assemblies of men, forbear,
my friends, 2 and leave me alone to pine in bitter
grief — unless indeed my father, goodly Odysseus,
despitefully wrought the well-greaved Achaeans woe,
in requital whereof ye work me woe despitefully by
urging these men on. For me it were better that

1 Or, possibly, " Lest in wrath they bring your evil deeds
upon your own heads." Against this, however, are xiv. 284
and xxiii. 64. •

2 These words are addressed apparently to the whole body
of the men of Ithaca, not to the wooers alone.

ye should yourselves eat up my treasures and my
flocks. If ye were to devour them, recompense
would haply be made some day ; for just so long
should we go up and down the city, pressing our
suit and asking back our goods, until all was given
back. But now past cure are the woes ye put upon
my heart."

Thus he spoke in wrath, and dashed the staff down
upon the ground, bursting into tears; and pity fell
upon all the people. Then all the others kept silent,
and no man had the heart to answer Telemachus
with angry words. Antinous alone answered him,
and said :

"Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in daring,
what a thing hast thou said, putting us to shame, and
wouldest fain fasten reproach upon us ! Nay, I tell
thee, it is not the Achaean wooers who are anywise
at fault, but thine own mother, for she is crafty above
all women. For it is now the third year and the
fourth will soon pass, 1 since she has been deceiving
the hearts of the Achaeans in their breasts. To
all she offers hopes, and has promises for each man,
sending them messages, but her mind is set on other
things. And she devised in her heart this guileful
thing also : she set up in her halls a great web, and
fell to weaving — fine of thread was the web and very
wide ; and straightway she spoke among us :

" ' Young men, my wooers, since goodly Odysseus
is dead, be patient, though eager for my marriage,
until I finish this robe — I would not that my spinning
should come to naught — a shroud for the lord Laertes,
against the time when the fell fate of grievous 2 death
shall strike him down ; lest any of the Achaean
' Others render " that lays men at their length."

women in the land should be wroth with me, if he,
who had won great possessions, were to lie without a
shroud.'

"So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented.
Then day by day she would weave at the great
web, but by night would unravel it, when she
had let place torches by her. Thus for three
years she by her craft kept the Achaeans from
knowing, and beguiled them ; but when the fourth
year came as the seasons rolled on, even then one
of her women who knew all told us, and we
caught her unravelling the splendid web. So she
finished it against her will, perforce. Therefore to
thee the wooers make answer thus, that thou mayest
thyself know it in thine heart, and that all the
Achaeans may know. Send away thy mother, and
command her to wed whomsoever her father bids,
and whoso is pleasing to her. But if she shall con-
tinue long time to vex the sons of the Achaeans,
mindful in her heart of this, that Athene has en-
dowed her above other women with knowledge of
fair handiwork and an understanding heart, and wiles,
such as we have never yet heard that any even of
tMfe women of old knew, of those who long ago were
fair-tressed Achaean women — Tyro and Alcmene and
Mycene of the fair crown — of whom not one was
like Penelope in shrewd device ; yet this at least
she devised not aright. For so long shall men
devour thy livelihood and thy possessions, even as
long as she shall keep the counsel which the gods
now put in her heart. Great fame she brings on
herself, but on thee regret for thy much substance.
For us, we will go neither to our lands nor else-
whither, until she marries that one of the Achaeans
whom she will."

Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said :
" Antinous, in no wise may I thrust forth from the
house against her will her that bore me and reared
me ; and, as for my father, he is in some other land,
whether he be alive or dead. An evil thing it were
for me to pay back a great price to Icarius, as I must,
if of my own will I send my mother away. For from
her father's hand shall I suffer evil, and heaven will
send other ills besides, for my mother as she leaves
the house will invoke the dread Avengers; and I
shall have blame, too, from men. Therefore will I
never speak this word. And for you, if your own
heart is wroth hereat, get you forth from my halls
and prepare you other feasts, eating your own sub-
stance and changing from house to house. But if
this seems in your eyes to be a better and more
profitable thing, that one man's livelihood should be
ruined without atonement, waste ye it. But I will
call upon the gods that are forever, if haply Zeus
may grant that deeds of requital may be wrought.
Without atonement then should ye perish within my
halls."

So spoke Telemachus, and in answer Zeus, whose
voice is borne afar, 1 sent forth two eagles, flying from
on high, from a mountain peak. For a time they
Hew swift as the blasts of the wind side by side with
wings outspread ; but when they reached the middle
of the many-voiced assembly, then they wheeled
about, flapping their wings rapidly, and down on the
heads of all they looked, and death was in their
glare. Then they tore with their talons one another's
cheeks and necks on either side, and darted away to
the right across the houses and the city of the men.

1 The adjective is sometimes rendered "far-seeing."

But they were seized with wonder at the birds when
their eyes beheld them, and pondered in their hearts
on what was to come to pass. Then among them
spoke the old lord Halitherses, son of Mastor, for he
surpassed all men of his day in knowledge of birds and
in uttering words of fate. He with good intent
addressed their assembly, and spoke among them :

"Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca, to the word
that I shall say ; and to the wooers especially do I
declare and announce these things, since on them a
great woe is rolling. For Odysseus shall not long be
away from his friends, but even now, methinks, he is
near, and is sowing death and fate for these men,
one and all. Aye, and to many others of us also
who dwell in clear-seen Ithaca will he be a bane.
But long ere that let us take thought how we may
make an end of this — or rather let them of them-
selves make an end, for this is straightway the better
course for them. Not as one untried do I prophesy,
but with sure knowledge. For unto Odysseus I
declare that all things are fulfilled even as I told
him, Avhen the Argives embarked for Uios and with
them went Odysseus of many wiles. I declared that
after suffering many ills and losing all his comrades
he would come home in the twentieth year unknown
to all ; and lo, all this is now being brought to
pass."

Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him,
and said : " Old man, up now, get thee home and
prophesy to thy children, lest haply in days to come
they suffer ill. In this matter I am better far than
thou to prophesy. Many birds there are that fare
to and fro under the rays of the sun, and not all are
fateful. As for Odysseus, he has perished far away,

as I would that thou hadst likewise perished with
him. Then wouldst thou not prate so much in thy
reading of signs, or be urging Telemachus on in his
wrath, hoping for some gift for thy house, if haply
he shall give it. But I will speak out to thee, and
this word shall verily be brought to pass. If thou,
wise in the wisdom of old, shalt beguile with thy talk
a younger man, and set him on to be wroth, for him
in the first place it shall be the more grievous, and he
will in no case be able to do aught because of these
men here, and on thee, old man, will we lay a fine
which it will grieve thy soul to pay, and bitter shall
be thy sorrow. And to Telemachus I myself, here
among all, will offer this counsel. His mother let
him bid to go back to the house of her father, and
they will prepare a wedding feast and make ready
the gifts full many, — aye, all that should follow
after a well-loved daughter. For ere that, methinks,
the sons of the Achaeans will not cease from their
grievous wooing, since in any case we fear no man, —
no, not Telemachus for all his many words, — nor do
we reck of any soothsaying which thou, old man,
mayest declare ; it will fail of fulfilment, and thou
shalt be hated the more. Aye, and his possessions
shall be devoured in evil wise, nor shall recpiital
ever be made, so long as she shall put off the
Achaeans in the matter of her marriage. And we
on our part waiting here day after day are rivals by
reason of her excellence, and go not after other
women, whom each one might fitly wed."

Then wise Telemachus answered him : " Eury-
machus and all ye other lordly wooers, in this matter
I entreat you no longer nor speak thereof, for now
the gods know it, and all the Achaeans. But come,

give me a swift ship and twenty comrades who will
accomplish my journey for me to and fro. For I
shall go to Sparta and to sandy Pylos to seek tidings
of the return of my father that has long been gone,
if haply any mortal man may tell me, or I may hear
a voice from Zeus, which oftenest brings tidings to
men. If so be I shall hear that my father is alive
and coming home, then verily, though I am sore
afflicted, I could endure for yet a year. But if I
shall hear that he is dead and gone, then I will
return to my dear native land and heap up a mound
for him, and over it pay funeral rites, full many, as
is due, and give my mother to a husband."

So saying he sat down, and among them rose
Mentor, who was a comrade of noble Odysseus. To
him, on departing with his ships, Odysseus had
given all his house in charge, that it should obey
the old man and that he should keep all things safe.
He with good intent addressed their assembly, and
spoke among them :

" Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca, to the word
that I shall say. Never henceforth let sceptred
king with a ready heart be kind and gentle, nor let
him heed righteousness in his heart, but let him
ever be harsh and work unrighteousness, seeing that
no one remembers divine Odysseus of the people
whose lord he was ; yet gentle was he as a father.
But of a truth I begrudge not the proud wooers that
they work deeds of violence in the evil contrivings
of their minds, for it is at the hazard of their own
lives that they violently devour the house of Odys-
seus, who, they say, will no more return. Nay,
rather it is with the rest of the folk that I am wroth,

1 So the word was understood in antiquity. Modern
scholars connect it with retpw, and make it mean " hard,"
" insolent."

* So the text, as it stands, must be interpreted. The
scholiast read in 251, «• vKsoves oi '4-xoivto, "even though he

that ye all sit thus in silence, and utter no word of
rebuke to make the wooers cease, though ye are
many and they but few."

Then Leocritus, son of Euenor, answered him :
" Mentor, thou mischief-maker, 1 thou wanderer in
thy wits, what hast thou said, bidding men make us
cease ? Nay, it were a hard thing to fight about
a feast with men that moreover outnumber you.
For if Ithacan Odysseus himself were to come and
be eager at heart to drive out from his hall the
lordly wooers who are feasting in his house, then
should his wife have no joy at his coming, though
sorely she longed for him, but right here would he
meet a shameful death, if he fought with men that
outnumbered him. 2 Thou hast not spoken aright.
But come now, ye people, scatter, each one of you
to his own lands. As for this fellow, Mentor and
Halitherses will speed his journey, for they are
friends of his father's house from of old. But me-
thinks he Mill long abide here and get his tidings
in Ithaca, and never accomplish this journey."

So he spoke, and hastily broke up the assembly.
They then scattered, each one to his own house ; and
the wooers went to the house of divine Odysseus.

But Telemachus went apart to the shore of the
sea, and having washed his hands in the grey sea-
water, prayed to Athene : " Hear me, thou who
didst come yesterday as a god to our house, and
didst bid me go in a ship over the mist} 7 deep to
seek tidings of the return of my father, that has

had the larger following." If this be adopted, the irXtoveaoi
in 245 may be construed with &pya\4ov, " Hard would it be
for you, though you are more in number than we." As it is,
Leocritus speaks defiantly, and denies that Mentor's party is
the more numerous.

long been gone. Lo, all this the Achaeans hinder,
but the wooers most of all in their evil insolence."

So he spoke in prayer, and Athene drew near to
him in the likeness of Mentor, both in form and in
voice; and she spoke, and addressed him with winged
words :

"Telemachus, neither hereafter shalt thou be a
base man or a witless, if aught of thy father's goodly
spirit has been instilled into thee, such a man was
he to fulfil both deed and word. So then shall this
journey of thine be neither vain nor unfulfilled. But
if thou art not the son of him and of Penelope, then
I have no hope that thou wilt accomplish thy desire.
Few sons indeed are like their fathers ; most are
worse, feAv better than their fathers. But since neither
hereafter shalt thou be a base man or a witless, nor
has the wisdom of Odysseus wholly failed thee, there
is therefore hope that thou wilt accomplish this work.
Now then let be the will and counsel of the wooers —
fools, for they are in no wise either prudent or just,
nor do they know aught of death or black fate, which
verily is near at hand for them, that they shall all
perish in a day. But for thyself, the journey on
which thy heart is set shall not be long delayed, so
true a friend of thy father's house am I, who will
equip for thee a swift ship, and myself go with thee.
But go thou now to the house and join the company
of the wooers ; make ready stores, and bestow all in
vessels — wine in jars, and barley meal, the marrow
of men, in stout skins ; — but I, going through the
town, will quickly gather comrades that go willingly.
And ships there are full many in sea-girt Ithaca,
both new and old ; of these will I choose out for
thee the one that is best, and quickly will we make
her ready and launch her on the broad deep."

So spoke Athene, daughter of Zeus, nor did Tele-
machus tarry long after he had heard the voice of
the goddess, but went his way to the house, his
heart heavy within him. He found there the proud
wooers in the halls, flaying goats and singeing swine
in the court. And Antinous with a laugh came
straight to Telemachus, and clasped his hand, and
spoke, and addressed 1 him :

"Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in
daring, let no more any evil deed or word be in
thy heart. Nay, I bid thee, eat and drink even as
before. All these things the Achaeans will surely
provide for thee — the ship and chosen oarsmen —
that with speed thou mayest go to sacred Pylos to
seek for tidings of thy noble father."

Then wise Telemachus answered him : " Antinous,
in no wise is it possible for me in your overweening
company to sit at meat quietly and to make merry
with an easy mind. Is it not enough, ye wooers,
that in time past ye wasted many goodly possessions
of mine, while I was still a child ? But now that I am
grown, and gain knowledge by heax-ing the words of
others, yea and my spirit waxes within me, I will try
how I may hurl forth upon you evil fates, either
going to Pylos or here in this land. For go I will,
nor shall the journey be in vain whereof I speak,
though I voyage in another's ship, since I may not
be master of ship or oarsmen. So, I ween, it seemed
to you to be more to your profit."

He spoke, and snatched his hand from the hand
of Antinous without more ado, and the wooers were
busy with the feast throughout the hall. They

equivalent to it. In a number of passages, however, the
word is freely used, and it has seemed best to adopt a render-
ing which suits all, or nearly all, cases.

mocked and jeered at him in their talk ; and thus
would one of the proud youths speak :

" Aye, verily Telemachus is planning our murder.
He will bring men to aid him from sandy Pylos or
even from Sparta, so terribly is he set upon it. Or
he means to go to Ephyre, that rich land, to bring
from thence deadly drugs, that he may cast them in
the wine-bowl, and destroy us all."

And again another of the proud youths would
say : " Who knows but he himself as he goes on
the hollow ship may perish wandering far from his
friends, even as Odysseus did ? So would he cause
us yet more labour; for we should have to divide
all "his possessions, and his house we should give
to his mother to possess, and to him who should
wed her."

So they spoke, but Telemachus went down to the
high-roofed treasure-chamber of his father, a wide
room where gold and bronze lay piled, and raiment
in chests, and stores of fragrant oil. There, too,
stood great jars of wine, old and sweet, holding with-
in them an unmixed divine drink, and ranged in
order along the wall, if ever Odysseus should return
home even after many grievous toils. Shut were
the double doors, close-fitted ; and there both night
and day a stewardess abode, who guarded all in
wisdom of mind, Eurycleia, daughter of Ops, son of
Peisenor. To her now Telemachus, when he had
called her to the treasure-chamber, spoke, and
said :

" Nurse, draw me off wine in jars, sweet wine that
is the choicest next to that which thou guardest ever
thinking upon that ill-fated one, if haply Zeus-born
Odysseus may come I know not whence, having

escaped from death and the fates. Fill twelve jars
and fit them all with covers, and pour me barley
meal into well-sewn skins, and let there be twenty
measures of ground barley meal. But keep know-
ledge hereof to thyself, and have all these things
brought together ; for at evening I will fetch them,
when my mother goes to her upper chamber and
bethinks her of her rest. For I am going to Sparta
and to sandy Pylos to seek tidings of the return of
my dear father, if haply I may hear any."

So he spoke, and the dear nurse, Eurycleia, uttered
a shrill cry, and weeping spoke to him winged words :
"Ah, dear child, how has this thought come into
thy mind? Whither art thou minded to go over
the wide earth, thou who art an only son and well-
beloved ? But he hath perished far from his country,
the Zeus-born Odysseus, in a strange land ; and
these men, so soon as thou art gone, will devise evil
for thee hereafter, that thou mayest perish by guile,
and themselves divide all these possessions. Nay,
abide here in charge of what is thine; thou hast no
need to suffer ills and go a wanderer over the un-
resting sea."

Then wise Telemachus answered her : " Take
heart, nurse, for not without a god's warrant is this
my plan. But swear to tell naught of this to my
dear mother until the eleventh or twelfth day shall
come, or until she shall herself miss me and hear
that I am gone, that she may not mar her fair flesh
with weeping."

So he spoke, and the old woman swore a great
oath by the gods to say naught. But when she had
sworn and made an end of the oath, straightway she
drew for him wine in jars, and poured barley meal

into well-sewn skins ; and Telemachus went to the
hall and joined the company of the wooers.

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, took
other counsel. In the likeness of Telemachus she
went everywhere throughout the city, and to each
of the men she drew near and spoke her word,
bidding them gather at even beside the swift ship.
Furthermore, of Noemon, the glorious son of Phronius,
she asked a swift ship, and he promised it to her
with a ready heart.

Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark.
Then she drew the swift ship to the sea and put
in it all the gear that well-benched ships carry.
And she moored it at the mouth of the harbour,
and round about it the goodly company was gathered
together, and the goddess heartened each man.

Then again the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene,
took other counsel. She went her way to the house
of divine Odysseus, and there began to shed sweet
sleep upon the wooers and made them to wander in
their drinking, and from their hands she cast the
cups. But they rose to go to their rest throughout
the city, and remained no long time seated, for sleep
was falling upon their eyelids. But to Telemachus
spoke flashing-eyed Athene, calling him forth before
the stately hall, having likened 'herself to Mentor
both in form and in voice :

"Telemachus, already thy well-greaved comrades
sit at the oar and await thy setting out. Come, let
us go, that we may not long delay their journey."

So saying, Pallas Athene led the way quickly,
and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess.
Now when they had come down to the ship and to

the sea, they found on the shore their long-haired
comrades, and the strong and mighty 1 Telemachus
spoke among them :

" Come, friends, let us fetch the stores, for all are
now gathered together in the hall. My mother
knows naught hereof, nor the handmaids either :
one only heard my word."

Thus saying, he led the way, and they went along
with him. So they brought and stowed everything
in the well-benched ship, as the dear son of Odysseus
bade. Then on board the ship stepped Telemachus,
and Athene went before him and sat down in the
stern of the ship, and near her sat Telemachus,
while the men loosed the stern cables and them-
selves stepped on board, and sat down upon the
benches. And flashing-eyed Athene sent them a
favourable wind, a strong-blowing West wind that
sang over the wine-dark sea. And Telemachus
called to his men, and bade them lay hold of the
tackling, and they hearkened to his call. The mast
of fir they raised and set in the hollow socket, and
made it fast with fore-stays, and hauled up the white
sail with twisted thongs of ox-hide. So the wind
filled the belly of the sail, and the dark wave sang
loudly about the stem of the ship as she went, and
she sped over the wave accomplishing her way.
Then, when they had made the tackling fast in the
swift black ship, they set forth bowls brim full of
wine, and poured libations to the immortal gods
that are forever, and chiefest of all to the flashing-
eyed daughter of Zeus. So all night long and through
the dawn the ship cleft her way.

It may be that in Up}} U and Uphv nevos (vii. 167) we should
see a reference to the sanctity attaching to royal station.

BOOK III

And now the sun, leaving the beauteous mere,
sprang up into the brazen heaven to give light to
the immortals and to mortal men on the earth, the
giver of grain ; and they came to Pylos, the well-
built citadel of Neleus. Here the townsfolk on the
shore of the sea were offering sacrifice of black bulls
to the dark-haired Earth-shaker. Nine companies
there were, and five hundred men sat in each, and
in each they held nine bulls ready for sacrifice.
Now when they had tasted the inner parts and were
burning the thigh-pieces to the god, the others put
straight in to the shore, and hauled up and furled
the sail of the shapely ship, and moored her, and
themselves stepped forth. Forth too from the ship
stepped Telemachus, and Athene led the way. And
the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, spake first to
him, and said :

" Telemachus, no longer hast thou need to feel
shame, no, not a whit. For to this end hast thou
sailed over the sea, that thou mightest seek tidings
of thy father, — where the earth covered him, and
what fate he met. But come now, go straightway
to Nestor, tamer of horses ; let us learn what counsel
he keepeth hid in his breast. And do thou beseech
him thyself that he may tell thee the very truth. A
lie will he not utter, for he is wise indeed."

THE ODYSSEY, III. 21-50

Then wise Telemachus answered her : " Mentor,
how shall I go, and how shall I greet him ? I am
as yet all unversed in subtle speech, and moreover a
young man has shame to question an elder."

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, answered
him : " Telemachus, somewhat thou wilt of thyself
devise in thy breast, and somewhat heaven too will
prompt thee. For, methinks, not without the
favour of the gods hast thou been born and reared."
So spake Pallas Athene, and led the way quickly ;
but he followed in the footsteps of the goddess; and
they came to the gathering and the companies of
the men of Pylos. There Nestor sat with his sons,
and round about his people, making ready the feast,
were roasting some of the meat and putting other
pieces on spits. But when they saw the strangers
they all came thronging about them, and clasped their
hands in welcome, and bade them sit down. First
Nestor's son Peisistratus came near and took both by
the hand, and made them to sit down at the feast
on soft fleeces upon the sand of the sea, beside his
brother Thrasymedes and his father. Thereupon he
gave them portions of the inner meat and poured
wine in a golden cup, and, pledging her, he spoke to
Pallas Athene, daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis:
" Pray now, stranger, to the lord Poseidon, for his
is the feast whereon you have chanced in coming
hither. And when thou hast poured libations and
hast prayed, as is fitting, then give thy friend also
the cup of honey-sweet wine that he may pour,
since he too, I ween, prays to the immortals ; for all
men have need of the gods. Howbeit he is the
younger, of like age with myself, wherefore to thee
first will I give the golden cup."

So he spake, and placed in her hand the cup of
sweet wine. But Pallas Athene rejoiced at the
man's wisdom and judgment, in that to her first
he gave the golden cup; and straightway she prayed
earnestly to the lord Poseidon :

" Hear me, Poseidon, thou Earth-enfolder, and
grudge not in answer to our prayer to bring these
deeds to fulfilment. To Nestor, first of all, and to
his sons vouchsafe renown, and then do thou grant
to the rest gracious requital for this glorious heca-
tomb, even to all the men of Pylos ; and grant
furthermore that Telemaehus and I may return
when we have accomplished all that for which we
came hither with our swift black ship."

Thus she prayed, and was herself fulfilling all.
Then she gave Telemaehus the fair two-handled 1
cup, and in like manner the dear son of Odysseus
prayed. Then when they had roasted the outer
flesh and drawn it off the spits, they divided the
portions and feasted a glorious feast. But when
they had put from them the desire of food and
drink, the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia, 2 spoke first
among them :

" Now verily is it seemlier to ask and enquire of
the strangers who they are, since now they have
had their joy of food. Strangers, who are ye?
Whence do ye sail over the watery ways ? Is it on
some business, or do ye wander at random over the
sea, even as pirates, who wander hazarding their
lives and bringing evil to men of other lands?"

Then wise Telemaehus took courage, and made
answer, for Athene herself put courage in his heart,

1 Others, "double cup," i.e. shaped like an hour-glasa.

2 The precise meaning of this epithet is quite unknown.

that he might ask about his father that was gone,
and that good report might be his among men :

" Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaeans,
thou askest whence we are, and I will surely tell
thee. We have come from Ithaca that is below
Neion ; but this business whereof I speak is mine
own, and concerns not the people. I come after
the wide-spread rumour of my father, if haply I
may hear of it, even of goodly Odysseus of the
steadfast heart, who once, men say, fought by thy
side and sacked the city of the Trojans. For of all
men else, as many as warred with the Trojans, we
learn where each man died a woeful death, but of
him the son of Cronos has made even the death to
be past learning ; for no man can tell surely where
he hath died, — whether he was overcome by foes on
the mainland, or on the deep among the waves of
Amphitrite. Therefore am I now come to thy
knees, if perchance thou wilt be willing to tell me
of his woeful death, whether thou sawest it haply
with thine own eyes, or didst hear from some other
the story of his wanderings ; 1 for beyond all men
did his mother bear him to sorrow. And do thou
nowise out of ruth or pity for me speak soothing
words, but tell me truly how thou didst come to
behold him. I beseech thee, if ever my father,
noble Odysseus, promised aught to thee of word or
deed and fulfilled it in the land of the Trojans,
where you Achaeans suffered woes, be mindful of it
now, I pray thee, and tell me the very truth."

Then the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia, answered
him : " My friend, since thou hast recalled to my
mind the sorrow which we endured in that land, we

sons of the Achaeans, unrestrained in daring, — all
that we endured on shipboard, as we roamed after
booty over the misty deep whithersoever Achilles
led ; and all our fightings around the great city of
king Priam ; — lo, there all our best were slain.
There lies warlike Aias, there Achilles, there
Patroclus, the peer of the gods in counsel ; and
there my own dear son, strong alike and peerless,
Antilochus, pre-eminent in speed of foot and as a
warrior. Aye, and many other ills we suffered
besides these ; who of mortal men could tell them
all ? Nay, if for five years' space or six years' space
thou wert to abide here, and ask of all the woes
which the goodly Achaeans endured there, thou
wouldest grow weary ere the end and get thee back
to thy native land. For nine years' space were we
busied plotting their ruin with all manner of wiles ;
and hardly did the son of Cronos bring it to passv-
There no man ventured to vie with him in counsel,
since goodly Odysseus far excelled in all manner of
wiles, — thy father, if indeed thou art his son.
Amazement holds me as I look on thee, for verily thy
speech is like his ; nor would one think that a younger
man would speak so like him. Now all the time
that we were there goodly Odysseus and I never
spoke at variance either in the assembly or in the
council, but being of one mind advised the ArgLves
with wisdom and shrewd counsel how all might be
for the best. But when we had sacked the lofty
city of Priam, and had gone away in our ships, and
a god had scattered the Achaeans, then, even then,
Zeus planned in his heart a woeful return for the
Argives, for in no wise prudent or just were all.

THE ODYSSEY, III. 134-162

Wherefore many of them met an evil fate through
the fell wrath of the flashing-eyed goddess, the
daughter of the mighty sire, for she caused strife
between the two sons of Atreus. Now these two
called to an assembly all the Achaeans, recklessly
and in no due order, at set of sun — and they came
heavy with wine, the sons of the Achaeans, — and
they spoke their word', and told wherefore they had
gathered the host together. Then in truth Menelaus
bade all the Achaeans think of their return over the
broad back of the sea, but in no wise did he please
Agamemnon, for he was fain to hold back the host
and to offer holy hecatombs, that he might appease
the dread wrath of Athene, — fool ! nor knew he
this, that with her was to be no hearkening ; for the
mind of the gods that are forever is not quickly
turned. So these two stood bandying harsh words ;
but the well-greaved Achaeans sprang up with a
wondrous din, and two-fold plans found favour with
them. That night we rested, each side pondering hard
thoughts against the other, for Zeus was bringing
upon us an evil doom, but in the morning some of us
launched our ships upon the bright sea, and put on
board our goods and the low-girdled women. Half,
indeed, of the host held back and remained there
with Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the
host, but half of us embarked and rowed away ; and
swiftly the ships sailed, for a god made smooth the
cavernous sea. But when we came to Tenedos, we
offered sacrifice to the gods, being eager to reach our
homes, howbeit Zeus did not yet purpose our return,
stubborn god, who roused evil strife again a second
time. Then some turned back their curved ships

and departed, even the lord Odysseus, the wise and
crafty -minded, with his company, once more showing
favour to Agamemnon, son of Atreus ; but I with the
full company of ships that followed me- fled on, for I
knew that the god was devising evil. And the war-
like son of Tydeus fled and urged on his men ; and
late upon our track came fair-haired Menelaus, and
overtook us in Lesbos, as we were debating the long
voyage, whether we should sail to sea- ward of rugged
Chios, toward the isle Psyria, keeping Chios itself 1
on our left, or to land-ward of Chios past windy
Mimas. So we asked the god to shew us a sign,
and he shewed it us, and bade us cleave through
the midst of the sea to Euboea, that we might the
soonest escape from misery. And a shrill wind
sprang up to blow, and the ships ran swiftly over
the teeming ways, and at night put in to Geraestus.
There on the altar of Poseidon we laid many thighs
of bulls, thankful to have traversed the great sea.
It was the fourth day when in Argos the company
of Diomedes, son of Tydeus, tamer of horses, stayed
their shapely ships ; but I held on toward Pylos, and
the wind was not once quenched from the time
when the god first sent.it forth to blow.

"Thus I came, dear child, without tidings, nor
know I aught of those others, who of the Achaeans
were saved, and who were lost. But what tidings
I have heard as I abide in our halls thou shalt hear,
as is, right, nor will I hide it from thee. Safely,
they say, came the Myrmidons that rage with the
spear, whom the famous son of great-hearted Achilles
led ; and safely Philoctetes, the glorious son of Poias.
All his company, too, diG Idomeneus bring to Crete,

1 Possibly, " keeping the isle (Psyria) on our left."

all who escaped the war, and the sea rohbed him of
none. But of the son of Atreus you have yourselves
heard, far off though you are, how he came, and
how Aegisthus devised for him a woeful doom. Yet
verily he paid the reckoning therefor in terrible
wise, so good a thing is it that a son be left behind
a man at his death, since that son took vengeance
on his father's slayer, the guileful Aegisthus, for
that he slew his glorious father. Thou, too, friend,
for I see thou art a comely man and tall, be thou
valiant, that many an one among men yet to be born
may praise thee."

Then wise Telemachus answered him : " Nestor,
son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaeans, yea
verily that son took vengeance, and the Achaeans
shall spread his fame abroad, that men who are yet
to be may hear thereof. O that the gods would
clothe me with such strength, that I might take
vengeance on the wooers for their grievous sin, who
in wantonness devise mischief against me. But lo,
the gods have spun for me no such happiness, for
me or for my father ; and now I must in any case
endure."

Then the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia, answered
him : " Friend, since thou calledst this to my mind
and didst speak of it, they say that many wooers for
the hand of thy mother devise evils in thy halls
in thy despite. Tell me, art thou willingly thus
oppressed, or do the people throughout the land
hate thee, following the voice of a god ? Who
knows but Odysseus may some day come and take
vengeance on them for their violent deeds, — he
alone, it may be, or even all the host of the
Achaeans? Ah, would that flashing-eyed Athene

might choose to love thee even as then she eared
exceedingly for glorious Odysseus in the land of
the Trojans, where we Achaeans suffered woes.
For never yet have I seen the gods so manifestly
shewing love, as Pallas Athene did to him, standing
manifest by his side. If she would be pleased to
love thee in such wise and would care for thee at
heart, then would many an one of them utterly
forget marriage."

Then wise Telemachus answered him : " Old man,
in no wise do I deem that this word will be brought
to pass. Too great is what thou sayest ; amazement
holds me. No hope have I that this will come to
pass, no, not though the gods should so will it."

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, spoke
to him, and said : " Telemachus, what a word has
escaped the barrier of thy teeth ! Easily might a
god who willed it bring a man safe home, even from
afar. But for myself, I had rather endure many
grievous toils ere I reached home and saw the day
of my returning, than after my return be slain at
my hearth, as Agamemnon was slain by the guile of
Aegisthus and of his own wife. But of a truth
death that is common to all J the gods themselves
cannot ward from a man they love, when the fell
fate of grievous death shall strike him down."

Then wise Telemachus answered her : " Mentor,
no longer let us tell of these things despite our grief.
For him no return can ever more be brought to
pass ; nay, ere this the immortals have devised for
him death and black fate. But now I would make
enquiry and ask Nestor regarding another matter,

war or strife. Some would read o\oltos, " baneful, destruc-
tive."

since beyond all others he knows judgments and
wisdom ; for thrice, men say, has he been king for a
generation of men, and like unto an immortal he
seems to me to look upon. Nestor, son of Neleus,
do thou tell me truly : how was the son of Atreus,
wide-ruling Agamemnon, slain ? Where was Mene-
laus ? What death did guileful Aegisthus plan for
the king, since he slew a man mightier far than
himself? Was Menelaus not in Achaean Argos,
but wandering elsewhere among men, so that
Aegisthus took heart and did the murderous deed ? "
Then the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia, answered
him : " Then verily, my child, will I tell thee all the
truth. Lo, of thine own self thou dost guess how
tins matter would have fallen out, if the son of
Atreus, fair-haired Menelaus, on his return from
Troy had found Aegisthus in his halls alive. Then
for him not even in death would they have piled
the up-piled earth, but the dogs and birds would
have torn him as he lay on the plain far from the
city, nor would any of the Achaean women have
bewailed him ; for monstrous was the deed he
devised. We on our part abode there in Troy ful-
filling our many toils ; but he, at ease in a nook of
horse-pasturing Argos, ever sought to beguile with
words the wife of Agamemnon. Now at the first
she put from her the unseemly deed, the beautiful
Clytemnestra, for she had an understanding heart ;
and with her was furthermore a minstrel whom the
son of Atreus straitly charged, when he set forth
for the land of Troy, to guard his wife. But when
at length the doom of the gods bound her that
she should be overcome, then verily Aegisthus took

the minstrel to a desert isle and left him to be the
prey and spoil of birds ; and her, willing as he was
willing, he led to his own house. And many thigh-
pieees he burned upon the holy altars of the gods,
and many offerings he hung up, woven stuffs and
gold, since he had accomplished a mighty deed
beyond all his heart had hoped.

" Now we were sailing together on our way from
Troy, the son of Atreus and I, in all friendship ; but
when we came to holy Sunium, the cape of Athens,
there Phoebus Apollo assailed with his gentle x
shafts and slew the helmsman of Menelaus, as he
held in his hands the steering-oar of the speeding
ship, even Phrontis, son of Onetor, who excelled
the tribes of men in piloting a ship when the storm
winds blow strong. So Menelaus tarried there,
though eager for his journey, that he might bury
his comrade and over him pay funeral rites. But
when he in his turn, as he passed over the wine-
dark sea in the hollow ships, reached in swift
course the steep height of Malea, then verily Zeus,
whose voice is borne afar, planned for him a hateful
path and poured upon him the blasts of shrill winds,
and the waves were swollen to huge size, like unto
mountains. Then, parting his ships in twain, he
brought some to Crete, where the Cydonians dwelt
about the streams of Iardanus. Now there is a
smooth cliff, sheer towards the sea, on the border
of Gortyn in the misty deep, where the South-
west Wind drives the great wave against the head-
land on the left toward Phaestus, and a little rock
holds back a great wave. Thither came some of
his ships, and the men with much ado escaped

1 A gentle, painless death was thought to be due to
Apollo's shafts.

destruction, liowbeit the ships the waves dashed
to pieces against the reef. But the five other dark-
prowed ships the wind, as it bore them, and the
wave brought to Egypt. So he was wandering
there with his ships among men of strange speech,
gathering much livelihood and gold ; but mean-
while Aejristhus devised this woeful work at home.
Seven years he reigned over Mycenae, rich in
gold, after slaying the son of Atreus, and the
people were subdued under him ; but in the eighth
came as his bane the goodly Orestes back from
Athens, and slew his father's murderer, the guileful
Aegisthus, for that he had slain his glorious father.
Now when he had slain him, he made a funeral
feast for the Argives over his hateful mother and
the craven Aegisthus ; and on the self-same day
there came to him Menelaus, good at the war-cry,
bringing much treasure, even all the burden that
his ships could bear.

" So do not thou, my friend, wander long far from
home, leaving thy wealth behind thee and men
in thy house so insolent, lest they divide and devour
all thy wealth, and thou shalt have gone on a fruit-
less journey. But to Menelaus I bid and command
thee to go, for he has but lately come from a strange
land, from a folk whence no one would hope in his
heart to return, whom the storms had once driven
astray into a sea so great, whence the very birds do
not fare in the space of a year, so great is it and
terrible. But now go thy way with thy ship and
thy comrades, or, if thou wilt go by land, here are
chariot and horses at hand for thee, and here at thy
service are my sons, who will be thy guides to goodly

Lacedaemon, where lives fair-haired Menelaas. And
do thou beseech him thyself that he may tell thee
the very truth. A lie will he not utter, for he is
wise indeed."

So he spoke, and the sun set, and darkness came
on. Then among them spoke the goddess, flashing-
eyed Athene : " Old man, of a truth thou hast told
this tale aright. But come, cut out the tongues of
the victims and mix the wine, that when we have
poured libations to Poseidon and the other im-
mortals, we may bethink us of sleep ; for it is the
time thereto. Even now has the light gone down
beneath the darkness, and it is not fitting to sit
long at the feast of the gods, but to go our
way."

So spoke the daughter of Zeus, and they hearken-
ened to her voice. Heralds poured water over their
hands, and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink,
and served out to all, pouring first drops for libation
into the cups. Then they cast the tongues upon
the fire, and, rising up, poured libations upon them.
But when they had poured libations and had drunk
to their heart's content, then verily Athene and
godlike Telemachus were both fain to return to the
hollow ship ; but Nestor on his part sought to stay
them, and he spoke to them, saying :

"This may Zeus forbid, and the other immortal
gods, that ye should go from my house to your swift
ship as from one utterly without raiment and poor,
who has not cloaks and blankets in plenty in his
house, whereon both he and his guests may sleep
softly. Nay, in my house there are cloaks and fair
blankets. Never surely shall the dear son of this
man Odysseus lie down upon the deck of a ship,

while I yet live and children after me are left in
my halls to entertain strangers, even whosoever
shall come to my house."

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, answered
him : " Well indeed hast thou spoken in this, old
friend, and it were fitting for Telemachus to hearken
to thee, since it is far better thus. But while he
shall now follow with thee, that he may sleep in
thy halls, I for my part will go to the black ship,
that I may hearten my comrades and tell them all.
For alone among them I declare that I am an older
man ; the others are younger who follow in friend-
ship, all of them of like age with great-hearted
Telemachus. There will I lay me down by the
hollow black ship this night, but in the morning I
will go to the great-hearted Cauconians, where a
debt is owing to me, in no wise new or small. But
do thou send this man on his way with a chariot
and with thy son, since he has come to thy house,
and give him horses, the fleetest thou hast in running
and the best in strength."

So spoke the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, and
she departed in the likeness of a sea-eagle ; and
amazement fell upon all at the sight, and the old
man marvelled, when his eyes beheld it. And he
grasped the hand of Telemachus, and spoke, and
addressed him :

"Friend, in no wise do I think that thou wilt
prove a base man or a craven, if verily when thou
art so young the gods follow thee to be thy guides.
For truly this is none other of those that have their
dwellings on Olympus but the daughter of Zeus,
Tritogeneia, 1 the maid most glorious, she that

" Triton-born," possibly with reference to an actual stream
of that name (in Boeotia or Thessaly).

honoured also thy noble father among the Argives.
Nay, O Queen, be gracious, and grant to me fair
renown, to me and to my sons and to my revered
wife ; and to thee in return will I sacrifice a sleek 1
heifer, broad of brow, unbroken, which no man hath
yet led beneath the yoke. Her will I sacrifice, and
I will overlay her horns with gold."

So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard
him. Then the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia, led
them, his sons and the husbands of his daughters,
to his beautiful palace. And when they reached
the glorious palace of the king, they sat down in
rows on the chairs and high seats ; and on their
coming the old man mixed for them a bowl of
sweet wine, which now in the eleventh year the
housewife opened, when she had loosed the string
that held the lid. Thereof the old man bade mix
a bowl, and earnestly he prayed, as he poured
libations, to Athene, the daughter of Zeus who
bears the aegis. -^

But when they had poured libations, and had
drunk to their heart's content, they went, each to
his home, to take their rest. But the horseman,
Nestor of Gerenia, bade Telemachus, the dear son
of divine Odysseus, to sleep there on a corded
bedstead under the echoing portico, and by him
Peisistratus, of the good ashen spear, a leader of
men, who among his sons was still unwed in the
palace. But he himself slept in the inmost chamber
of the lofty house, and beside him lay the lady his
wife, who had strewn the couch.

Soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,

1 Scholars generally follow the ancient commentators, and
render fiviv " one year old." The meaning " sleek " was sug-
gested by Goebel, whom Ameis follows.

up from his bed rose the horseman, Nestor of
Gerenia, and went forth and sat down on the
polished stones which were before his lofty doors,
white and glistening as with oil. 1 On these of old
was wont to sit Neleus, the peer of the gods in
counsel ; but he ere this had been stricken by fate
and had gone to the house of Hades, and now there
sat upon them in his turn Nestor of Gerenia, the
warder of the Achaeans, holding a sceptre in his
hands. About him his sons gathered in a throng
as they came forth from their chambers, Echephron
and Stratius and Perseus and Aretus and godlike
Thrasymedes ; and to these thereafter came as the
sixth the lord Peisistratus. And they led godlike
Telemachus and made him sit beside them ; and
the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia, was first to speak
among them :

"Quickly, my dear children, fulfil my desire, that
first of all the gods I may propitiate Athene, who
came to me in manifest presence to the rich feast of
the god. Come now, let one go to the plain for a
heifer, that she may come speedily, and that the
neatherd may drive her ; and let one go to the
black ship of great-hearted Telemachus and bring
all his comrades, and let him leave two men only ;
and let one again bid the goldsmith Laerces come
hither, that he may overlay the heifer's horns with
gold. And do ye others abide here together ; and
bid the handmaids within to make ready a feast
throughout our glorious halls, to fetch seats, and
logs to set on either side of the altar, and to bring
clear water."

1 So Eustathius and the scholia. Others think of a wash
or stucco, covering the stones.

THE ODYSSEY, III. 430-454

So he spoke, and they all set busily to work.
The heifer came from the plain ; and from the swift,
shapely ship came the comrades of great-hearted
Telemachus ; the smith came, bearing in his hands
his tools of bronze, the implements of his craft, anvil
and hammer and well-made tongs, wherewith he
wrought the gold ; and Athene came to accept
the sacrifice. Then the old man, Nestor, the
driver of chariots, gave gold, and the smith pre-
pared it, and overlaid therewith the horns of the
heifer, that the goddess might rejoice when she
beheld the offering. And Stratius and goodly
Echephron led the heifer by the horns, and Aretus
came from the chamber, bringing them water for
the hands in a basin embossed with flowers, and
in the other hand he held barley grains in a
basket ; and Thrasymedes, steadfast in fight, stood
by, holding in his hands a sharp axe, to fell the
heifer ; and Perseus held the bowl for the blood.
Then the old man, Nestor, driver of chariots, began
the opening rite of hand-washing and sprinkling
with barley grains, and earnestly he prayed to
Athene, cutting off' as first offering the hair from
the head, and casting it into the fire.

Now when they had prayed, and had strewn the
barley grains, straightway the son of Nestor, Thrasy-
medes, high of heart, came near and dealt the
blow ; and the axe cut through the sinews of the
neck, and loosened the strength of the heifer.
Then the women raised the sacred cry, the daughters
and the sons' wives and the revered wife of Nestor,
Eurydice, the eldest of the daughters of Clymenus,
and the men raised the heifer's head from the
broad wayed earth and held it, and Peisistratus,

leader of men, cut the throat. And when the black
blood had flowed from her and the life had left the
bones, at once they cut up the body and straight-
way cut out the thigh-pieces all in due order, and
covered them with a double layer of fat, and laid raw
flesh upon them. Then the old man burned them
on billets of wood, and poured over them flaming
wine, and beside him the young men held in their
hands the five-pronged forks. But Avhen the thigh-
pieces were wholly burned, and they had tasted the
inner parts, they cut up the rest and spitted and
roasted it, holding the pointed spits in their hands.

Meanwhile the fair Polycaste, the youngest daugh-
ter of Nestor, son of Neleus, bathed Telemachus.
And when she had bathed him and anointed him
richly l with oil, and had cast about him a fair cloak
and a tunic, forth from the bath he came in form
like unto the immortals ; and he went and sat down
by Nestor, the shepherd of the people.

Now when they had. roasted the outer flesh and
had drawn it off the spits, they sat down and
feasted, and worthy men waited on them, pouring
wine 2 into golden cups. But when they had put
from them the desire of food and drink, the horse-
man, Nestor of Gerenia, was first to speak, saying :

" My sons, up, yoke for Telemachus horses with
beautiful mane beneath the car, that he may get
forward on his journey."

So he spoke, and they readily hearkened and
obeyed; and quickly they yoked .beneath the car
the swift horses. And the housewife placed in the
car bread and wine and dainties, such as kings,

fostered of Zeus, are wont to eat. Then Tele-
machus mounted the beautiful car, and Peisistratus,
son of Nestor, a leader of men, mounted beside him,
and took the reins in his hands. He touched the
horses with the whip to start them, and nothing
loath the pair sped on to the plain, and left the
steep citadel of Pylos. So all day long they shook
the yoke which they bore about their necks.

Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark.
And they came to Pherae, to the house of Diocles,
son of Ortilochus, whom Alpheus begot. There
they spent the night, and before them he set the
entertainment due to strangers.

So soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,
they yoked the horses and mounted the inlaid car,
and drove forth from the gateway and the echoing
portico. Then Peisistratus touched the horses with
the whip to start them, and nothing loath the pair
sped onward. So they came to the wheat-bearing
plain, and thereafter pressed on toward their
journey's end, so well did their swift horses bear
them on. And the sun set and all the ways grew
dark.

BOOK IV

And they came to the hollow land of Laeedaemon
with its many ravines, and drove to the palace of
glorious Menelaus. Him they found giving a mar-
riage feast to his many kinsfolk for his noble son and
daughter within his house. His daughter he was
sending to the son of Achilles, breaker of the ranks
of men, for in the land of Troy he first had promised
and pledged that he would give her, and now the
gods were bringing their marriage to pass. Her then
he was sending forth with horses and chariots to go
her way to the glorious city of the Myrmidons, over
whom her lord was king ; but for his son he was
bringing to his home from Sparta the daughter of
Alector, even for the stalwart Megapenthes, who
was his son well-beloved, 1 born of a slave woman ;
for to Helen the gods vouchsafed issue no more after
that she had at the first borne her lovely child,
Hermione, who had the beauty of golden Aphrodite.
So they were feasting in the great high-roofed hall,
the neighbours and kinsfolk of glorious Menelaus,
and making merry ; and among them a divine min-
strel was singing to the lyre, and two tumblers
whirled up and down through the midst of them,
as he began his song.

1 I follow Buttmann in the rendering of this doubtful
word. Suggested etymologies are not convincing. Others
take the word to mean " grown big."

THE ODYSSEY, IV. 20-48

Then the two, the prince Telemachus and the
glorious son of Nestor, halted at the gateway of the
palace, they and their two horses. And the lord
Eteoneus came forth and saw them, the busy squire
of glorious Menelaus; and he went through the hall
to bear the tidings to the shepherd of the people.
So he came near and spoke to him winged words :

" Here are two strangers, Menelaus, fostered of
Zeus, two men that are like the seed of great Zeus.
But tell me, shall we unyoke for them their swift
horses, or send them on their way to some other
host, who will give them entertainment?"

Then, stirred to sore displeasure, fair-haired Mene-
laus spoke to him : " Aforetime thou wast not wont
to be a fool, Eteoneus, son of Boethous, but now like
a child thou talkest folly. Surely we two ate full
often hospitable cheer of other men, ere we came
hither in the hope that Zeus would hereafter grant
us respite from sorrow. Nay, unyoke the strangers'
horses, and lead the men forward into the house,
that they may feast."

So he spoke, and the other hastened through the
hall, and called to the other busy squires to follow
along with him. They loosed the sweating horses
from beneath the yoke and tied them at the stalls
of the horses, and Hung before them spelt, and mixed
therewith white barley. Then they tilted the chariot
against the bright entrance walls, and led the men
into the divine palace. But at the sight they mar-
velled as they passed through the palace of the king,
fostered of Zeus ; for there was a gleam as of sun or
moon over the high-roofed house of glorious Mene-
laus. But when they had satisfied their eyes with
gazing they went into the polished baths and bathed.

THE ODYSSEY, IV. 49-73

And when the maids had bathed them and anointed
them with oil, and had cast about them fleecy cloaks
and tunics, they sat down on chairs beside Menelaus,
son of Atreus. Then a handmaid brought water for
the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over
a silver basin for them to wash, and beside them
drew up a polished table. And the grave housewife
brought and set before them bread, and therewith
dainties in abundance, giving freely of her store.
And a carver lifted up and placed before them plat-
ters of all manner of meats, and set by them golden
goblets. Then fair-haired Menelaus greeted the two
and said :

" Take of the food, and be glad, and then when
you have supped, we will ask you who among men
you are ; for in you two the breed of your sires is
not lost, but ye are of the breed of men that are
sceptred kings, fostered of Zeus ; for base churls
could not beget such sons as you."

So saying he took in his hands roast meat and set
it before them, even the fat ox-chine which they had
set before himself as a mess of honour. So they put
forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready
before them. But when they had put from them
the desire of food and drink, lo, then Telemachus
spoke to the son of Nestor, holding his head close to
him, that the others might not hear :

" Son of Nestor, dear to this heart of mine, mark
the flashing of bronze throughout the echoing halls,
and the flashing of gold, of electrum, 1 of silver, and

1 Probably here the metal is meant, an alloy of gold and
silver. In xv. 460 and xviii. 29b' the word, in the plural,
means "amber beads."

of ivory. Of such sort, methinks, is the court of
Olympian Zeus within, such untold wealth is here ;
amazement holds me as I look."

Now as he spoke fair-haired Menelaus heard him,
and he spoke and addressed them with winged words:

" Dear children, with Zeus verily no mortal man
could vie, for everlasting are his halls and his pos-
sessions ; but of men another might vie with me in
wealth or haply might not. For of a truth after
many woes and wide wanderings I brought my
wealth home in my ships and came in the eighth
year. Over Cyprus and Phoenicia I wandered, and
Egypt, and I came to the Ethiopians and the
Sidonians and the Erembi, and to Libya, where
the lambs are horned from their birth. 1 For
there the ewes bear their young thrice within the
full course of the year ; there neither master nor
shepherd has any lack of cheese or of meat or of
sweet milk, but the flocks ever yield milk to the
milking the year through. While I wandered in
those lands gathering much livelihood, meanwhile
another slew my brother by stealth and at unawares,
by the guile of his accursed wife. Thus, thou mayest
see, I have no joy in being lord of this wealth ; and
you may well have heard of this from your fathers,
whosoever they may be, for full much did I suffer,
nnd let fall into ruin a stately house and one stored
with much goodly treasure. Would that I dwelt in
my halls with but a third part of this wealth, and
that those men were safe who then perished in the
broad land of Troy far from horse-pasturing Argos.

1 So Aristotle understood the passage (H.A. viii. 28) ;
Herodotus, on the contrary, took the meaning to be " begin
at once to become horned " {iv. 29). Eustathius agrees with
Herodotus.

THE ODYSSEY, IV. 100-126

And yet, though I often sit in my halls weeping
and sorrowing for them all — one moment indeed I
ease my heart with weeping, and then again I
cease, for men soon have surfeit of chill lament —
yet for them all I mourn not so much, despite my
grief, as for one only, who makes me to loathe both
sleep and food, when I think of him ; for no one
of the Achaeans toiled so much as Odysseus toiled
and endured. But to himself, as it seems, his
portion was to be but woe, and for me there is
sorrow never to be forgotten for him, in that he
is gone so long, nor do we know aught whether
he be alive or dead. Mourned is he, I ween, by the
old man Laertes, and by constant Penelope, and by
Telemachus, whom he left a new-born child in his
house."

So he spoke, and in Telemachus he roused the
desire to weep for his father. Tears from his eye-
lids he let fall upon the ground, when he heard his
father's name, and with both hands held up his
purple cloak before his eyes. And Menelaus noted
him, and debated in mind and heart whether he
should leave him to speak of his father himself, or
whether he should first question him and prove him
in each thing.

While he pondered thus in mind and heart, forth
then from her fragrant high-roofed chamber came
Helen, like Artemis of the golden arrows ; x and with
her came Adraste, and placed for her a chair, beau-
tifully wrought, and Alcippe brought a rug of soft
wool and Phylo a silver basket, which Alcandre had
given her, the wife of Polybus, who dwelt in Thebes

pf Egypt, where greatest store of wealth is laid up
in men's houses. He gave to Menelans two silver
baths and two tripods and ten talents of gold. And
besides these, his wife gave to Helen also beautiful
gifts, — a golden distaff and a basket with wheels
beneath did she give, a basket of silver, and with
gold were the rims thereof gilded. 1 This then the
handmaid, Phylo, brought and placed beside her,
filled with finely-spun yarn, and across it was laid
the distaff laden with violet-dai'k wool. So Helen
sat down upon the chair, and below was a footstool
for the feet; and at once she questioned her husband
on each matter, and said :

" Do we know, Menelaus, fostered of Zeus, who
these men declare themselves to be who have come
to our house? Shall I disguise my thought, or speak
the truth ? Nay, my heart bids me speak. For
never yet, I declare, saw I one so like another,
whether man or woman — amazement holds me, as
I look — as this man is like the son of great-hearted
Odysseus, even Telemachus, whom that warrior left
a new-born child in his house, when for the sake of
shameless me ye Achaeans came up under the walls
of Troy, pondering in your hearts fierce war."

Then fair-haired Menelaus answered her : " Even
so do I myself now note it, wife, as thou markest
the likeness. Such were his feet, such his hands,
and the glances of his eyes, and his head and hair
above. And verily but now, as I made mention of
Odysseus and was telling of all the woe and toil
he endured for my sake, this youth let fall a bitter
tear from beneath his brows, holding up his purple
cloak before his eyes."

1 Others render, " were finished."

Then Peisistratus, son of Nestor, answered him :
" Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader
of hosts, his son indeed this youth is, as thou sayest.
But he is of prudent mind and feels shame at heart
thus on his first coming to make a show of forward
words in the presence of thee, in whose voice we
both take delight as in a god's. But the horseman,
Nestor of Gerenia, sent me forth to go with him as
his guide, for he was eager to see thee, that thou
mightest put in his heart some word or some deed.
For many sorrows has a son in his halls when his
father is gone, when there are none other to be his
helpers, even as it is now with Telemacluis ; his
father is gone, and there are no others among the
people who might ward off ruin."

Then fair-haired Menelaus answered him and
said: " Lo now, verily is there come to my house
the son of a man well-beloved, who for my sake
endured many toils. And I thought that if he came
back I should give him welcome beyond all the
other Argives, if Olympian Zeus, whose voice is
borne afar, had granted to us two a return in our
swift ships over the sea. And in Argos I would
have given him a city to dwell in, and would have
built him a house, when I had brought him from
Ithaca with his goods and his son and all his people,
driving out the dwellers of some one city among
those that lie round about and obey me myself as
their lord. Then, living here, should we ofttimes
have met together, nor would aught have parted us,
loving and joying in one another, until the black
cloud of death enfolded us. Howbeit of this, me-
thinks, the god himself must have been jealous, who
to that hapless man alone vouchsafed no return."

So he spoke, and in them all aroused the desire of
lament. Argive Helen wept, the daughter of Zeus,
Telemachus wept, and Menelaus, son of Atreus, nor
could the son of Nestor keep his eyes tearless. For
he thought in his heart of peerless Antiloehus, whom
the glorious son of the bright Dawn 1 had slain.
Thinking of him, he spoke winged words :

"Son of Atreus, old Nestor used ever to say that
thou wast wise above all men, whenever we made
mention of thee in his halls and questioned one
another. And now, if it may in any wise be,
hearken to me, for I take no joy in weeping at
supper time, 2 — and moreover early dawn will soon
be here. 3 I count it indeed no blame to weep for
any mortal who has died and met his fate. Yea,
this is the only due we pay to miserable mortals, to
cut the hair and let a tear fall from the cheeks.
For a brother of mine, too, is dead, nowise the
meanest of the Argives, and thou mayest well have
known him. As for me, I never met him nor saw him ;
but men say that Antiloehus was above all others
pre-eminent in speed of foot and as a warrior."

Then fair-haired Menelaus answered him and
said : " My friend, truly thou hast said all that a
wise man might sav or do, even one that was older
than thou ; for from such a father art thou sprung,
wherefore thou dost even speak wisely. Easily
known is the seed of that man for whom the son of
Cronos spins the thread of good fortune at marriage
and at birth, even as now he has granted to Nestor
throughout all his days continually that he should

1 i.e. Memnon, leader of the Ethiopians.

himself reach a sleek old age in his halls, and that
his sons in their turn should be wise and most
valiant with the spear. But we will cease the weep-
ing which but now was made, and let us once more
think of our supper, and let them pour water over
our hands. Tales there will be in the morning also
for Telemachus and me to tell to one another to the
full."

So he spoke, and Asphalion poured water over
their hands, the busy squire of glorious Menelaus.
And they put forth their hands to the good cheer
lying ready before them.

Then Helen, daughter of Zeus, took other counsel.
Straightway she cast into the wine of which they
were drinking a drug to quiet all pain and strife,
and bring forgetfulness of every ill. Whoso should
drink this down, when it is mingled in the bowl,
would not in the course of that day let a tear fall
down over his cheeks, no, not though his mother
and father should lie there dead, or though before
his face men should slay with the sword his brother
or dear son, and his own eyes beheld it. Such
cunning drugs had the daughter of Zeus, drugs of
healing, which Polydamna, the wife of Thon, had
given her, a woman of Egypt, for there the earth,
the giver of grain, bears greatest store of drugs,
many that are healing when mixed, and many that
are baneful ; there every man is a physician, wise
above human kind ; for they are of the race of
Paeeon. Now when she had cast in the drug, and
had bidden pour forth the wine, again she made
answer, and said :

" Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, and
ye that are here, sons of noble men — though now to

one and now to another Zeus gives good and ill, for
he can do all things, — now verily sit ye in the halls
and feast, and take ye joy in telling tales, for I will
tell what fitteth the time. All things I cannot tell
or recount, even all the labours of Odysseus of the
steadfast heart ; but what a thing was this which
that mighty man wrought and endured in the land
of the Trojans, where you Achaeans suffered woes !
Marring his own body with cruel blows, and flinging
a wretched garment about his shoulders, in the
fashion of a slave he entered the broad-wayed city
of the foe, and he hid himself under the likeness of
another, a beggar, he who was in no wise such an
one at the ships of the Achaeans. In this likeness
he entered the city of the Trojans, and all of them
were but as babes. 1 I alone recognised him in this
disguise, and questioned him, but he in his cunning
sought to avoid me. Howbeit when I was bathing
him and anointing him with oil, and had put on him
raiment, and sworn a mighty oath not to make him
known among the Trojans as Odysseus before that
he reached the swift ships and the huts, then at
length he told me all the purpose of the Achaeans.
And when he had slain many of the Trojans with
the long sword, he returned to the company of
the Argives and brought back plentiful tidings.
Then the other Trojan women wailed aloud, but my
soul was glad, for already my heart was turned to
go back to my home, and I groaned for the blind-
ness that Aphrodite gave me, when she led me
thither from my dear native land, forsaking my

child and my bridal chamber, and my husband, a
man who lacked nothing, whether in wisdom or in
comeliness."

Then fair-haired Menelaus answered her and said :
" Aye verily, all this, wife, hast thou spoken aright.
Ere now have I come to know the counsel and the
mind of many warriors, and have travelled over the
wide earth, but never yet have mine eyes beheld
such an one as was Odysseus of the steadfast heart.
What a thing was this, too, -which that mighty man
wrought and endured in the carven horse, wherein
all we chiefs of the Argives were sitting, bearing
to the Trojans death and fate ! Then thou earnest
thither, and it must be that thou wast bidden by
some god, who wished to grant glory to the Trojans,
and godlike Deiphobus followed thee on thy way.
Thrice didst thou go about the hollow ambush,
trying it with thy touch, and thou didst name aloud
the chieftains of the Danaans by their names, liken-
ing thy voice to the voices of the wives of all the
Argives. Now I and the son of Tydeus and goodly
Odysseus sat there in the midst and heard how thou
didst call, and we two were eager to rise up and
come forth, or else to answer sti-aightway from
within, but Odysseus held us back and stayed us,
despite our eagerness. Then all the other sons of
the Achaeans held their peace, but Anticlus alone
was fain to speak and answer thee ; but Odysseus
firmly closed his mouth with strong hands, and

Then wise Telemachus answered him : " Menelaus,
son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, all
the more grievous is it; for in no wise did this ward

off' from him woeful destruction, nay, not though
the heart within him had been of iron. But come,
send us to bed, that lulled now by sweet sleep we
may rest and take our joy."

Thus he spoke, and Argive Helen bade her hand-
maids place bedsteads beneath the portico, and to
lay on them fair purple blankets, and to spread
thereover coverlets, and on these to put fleecy cloaks
for clothing. But the maids went forth from the
hall with torches in their hands and strewed the
couch, and a herald led forth the guests. So they
slept there in the fore-hall of the palace, the prince
Telemachus and the glorious son of Nestor ; but the
son of Atreus slept in the inmost chamber of the
lofty house, and beside him lay long-robed Helen,
peerless among women.

So soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,
up from his bed arose Menelaus, good at the war-
cry, and put on his clothing. About his shouldex^s
he slung his sharp sword, and beneath his shining
feet bound his fair sandals, and went forth from
his chamber like unto a god to look upon. Then
he sat down beside Telemachus, and spoke, and
addressed him :

" What need has brought thee hither, prince
Telemachus, to goodly Lacedaemon over the broad
back of the sea ? Is it a public matter, or thine
own ? Tell me the truth of this."

Then wise Telemachus answered him : " Menelaus,
son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, I
came if haply thou mightest tell me some tidings of
my father. My home is being devoured and my
rich lands are ruined ; with men that are foes my
house is filled, who are ever slaying my thronging

sheep and my sleek kine of shambling gait, even
the wooers of my mother, overweening in their
insolence. Therefore am I now come to thy knees,
if perchance thou wilt be willing to tell me of his
woeful death, whether thou sawest it haply with
thine own eyes, or didst hear from some other the
story of his wanderings ; for beyond all men did his
mother bear him to sorrow. And do thou no wise
out of ruth or pity for me speak soothing words, but
tell me truly how thou didst come to behold him.
I beseech thee, if ever my father, noble Odysseus,
promised aught to thee of word or deed and fulfilled
it in the land of the Trojans, where you Achaeans
suffered woes, be mindful of it now, I pray thee, and
tell me the truth."

Then, stirred to sore displeasure, fair-haired Mene-
laus spoke to him : " Out upon them, for verily
in the bed of a man of valiant heart were they
fain to lie, who are themselves cravens. Even as
when in the thicket-lair of a mighty lion a hind
has laid to sleep her new-born suckling fawns, and
roams over the mountain slopes and grassy vales
seeking pasture, and then the lion comes to his
lair and upon the two 1 lets loose a cruel doom,
so will Odysseus let loose a cruel doom upon these
men. I would, O father Zeus and Athene and
Apollo, that in such strength as when once in fair-
stablished Lesbos he rose up and wrestled a match
with Philomeleides and threw him mightily, and
all the Achaeans rejoiced, even in such strength
Odysseus might come among the wooers ; then

1 The Greek seems to denote a pair of fawns, the slaying
taking place in the absence of the hind ; cf. Iliad, xi. 113 ff.
Others assume that the dual means " both hind and fawns."

should they all find swift destruction and bitterness
in their wooing. But in this matter of which thou
dost ask and beseech me, verily I will not swerve
aside to speak of other things, nor will I deceive
thee ; but of all that the unerring old man of the
sea told me not one thing will I hide from thee or
conceal.

"In Egypt, 1 eager though I was to journey hither,
the gods still held me back, because I offered not to
them hecatombs that bring fulfilment, and the gods
ever wished that men should be mindful of their
commands. Now there is an island in the surging
sea in front of Egypt, and men call it Pharos,
distant as far as a hollow ship runs in a whole day
when the shrill wind blows fair behind her. Therein
is a harbour with good anchorage, whence men
launch the shapely ships into the sea, when they
have drawn supplies of black 2 water. There for
twenty days the gods kept me, nor ever did the
winds that blow over the deep spring up, which
speed men's ships over the broad back of the sea.
And now would all my stores have been spent and
the strength of my men, had not one of the gods
taken pity on me and saved me, even Eidothea,
daughter of mighty Proteus, the old man of the sea ;
for her heart above all others had I moved. She
met me as I wandered alone apart from my com-
rades, who were ever roaming about the island,
fishing with bent hooks, for hunger pinched their
bellies ; and she came close to me, and spoke, and
said :

2 The epithet " black " is applied to water in deep places,
where the light cannot reach it, and to water trickling down
the face of a rock covered with lichens (Iliad, xvi. 4 ff.).

"'Art thou so very foolish, stranger, and slack of
wit, or art thou of thine own will remiss, and hast
pleasure in suffering woes ? So long art thou pent
in the isle and canst find no sign of deliverance, 1
and the heart of thy comrades grows faint.'

" So she spoke, and I made answer and said : ' I will
speak out and tell thee, whosoever among goddesses
thou art, that in no wise am I pent here of mine
own will, but it must be that I have sinned against
the immortals, who hold broad heaven. But do
thou tell me — for the gods know all things — who of
the immortals fetters me here, and has hindered me
from my path, and tell me of my return, how I may
go over the teeming deep.'

" So I spoke, and the beautiful goddess straightway
made answer: 'Then verily, stranger, will 1 frankly
tell thee all. There is wont to come hither the
unerring old man of the sea, immortal Proteus of
Egypt, who knows the depths of every sea, and is
the servant of Poseidon. He, they say, is my father
that begat me. If thou couldst in any wise lie in
wait and catch him, he will tell thee thy way and
the measure of thy path, and of thy return, how
thou mayest go over the teeming deep. Aye, and
he will tell thee, thou fostered of Zeus, if so thou
wilt, what evil and what good has been wrought in
thy halls, while thou hast been gone on thy long and
grievous way.'

" So she spoke, and I made answer and said : ' Do
thou thyself now devise a means of lying in wait for
the divine old man, lest haply he see me beforehand
and being ware of my purpose avoid me. For hard
is a god for a mortal man to master.'

" So I spoke, and the beautiful goddess straightway
made answer : ' Then verily, stranger, will I frankly
tell thee all. When the sun hath reached mid
heaven, the unerring old man of the sea is wont
to come forth from the brine at the breath of the
West Wind, hidden by the dark ripple. And when
he is come forth, he lies down to sleep in the hollow
caves ; and around him the seals, the brood of the
fair daughter of the sea, sleep in a herd, coming
forth from the gray water, and bitter is the smell
they breathe of the depths of the sea. Thither will
I lead thee at break of day and lay you all in a
row ; for do thou choose carefully three of thy com-
panions, who are the best thou hast in thy well-
benched ships. And I will tell thee all the wizard
wiles of that old man. First he will count the
seals, and go over them 4 ; but when he has told them
all off by fives, and beheld them, he will lay himself
down in their midst, as a shepherd among his flocks
of sheep. Now so soon as you see him laid to rest,
thereafter let your hearts be filled with strength
and courage, and do you hold him there despite his
striving and struggling to escape. For try he will,
and will assume all manner of shapes of all things
that move upon the earth, and of water, and of
wondrous blazing fire. Yet do ye hold him unflinch-
ingly and grip him yet the more. But when at length
of his own will he speaks and questions thee in that
shape in which you saw him laid to rest, then, hero,
stay thy might, and set the old man free, and ask
him who of the gods is wroth with thee, and of
thy return, how thou mayest go over the teeming
deep.'

"So saying she plunged beneath the surging sea,
but I went to my ships, where they stood on the
sand, and many things did my heart darkly ponder
as I went. But when I had come down to the ship
and to the sea, and we had made ready our supper,
and immortal night had come on, then we lay down
to rest on the shore of the sea. And as soon as
early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, I went
along the shore of the broad-wayed sea, praying
earnestly to the gods ; and I took with me three of
my comrades, in whom I trusted most for every
adventure.

"She meanwhile had plunged beneath the broad
bosom of the sea, and had brought forth from the
deep the skins of four seals, and all were newly
flayed ; and she devised a plot against her father.
She had scooped out lairs in the sand of the sea,
and sat waiting ; and we came very near to her, and
she made us to lie down in a row, and cast a skin over
each. Then would our ambush have proved most
terrible, for terribly did the deadly stench of the
brine-bred seals distress us — who would lay him
down by a beast of the sea? — but she of herself
delivered us, and devised a great boon ; she brought
and placed ambrosia of a very sweet fragrance
beneath each man's nose, and destroyed the stench
of the beast. So all the morning we waited with
steadfast heart, and the seals came forth from the
sea in throngs. These then laid them down in
rows along the shore of the sea, and at noon the old
man came forth from the sea and found the fatted
seals ; and he went over all, and counted their
number. Among the creatures he counted us first,
nor did his heart guess that there was guile ; and

then he too laid him down. Thereat we rushed
upon him with a shout, and threw our arms about
him, nor did that old man forget his crafty wiles.
Nay, at the first he turned into a bearded lion, and
then into a serpent, and a leopard, and a huge boar ;
then he turned into flowing water, and into a tree,
high and leafy ; but we held on unflinchingly with
steadfast heart. But when at last that old man,
skilled in wizard arts, grew weary, then he ques-
tioned me, and spoke, and said :

" ' Who of the gods, son of Atreus, took counsel
with thee that thou mightest lie in wait for me,
and take me against my will ? Of what hast thou
need ? '

" So he spoke, and I made answer, and said :
' Thou knowest, old man — why dost thou seek to
put me off with this question ? — how long a time
I am pent in this isle, and can find no sign of
deliverance, and my heart grows faint within me.
But do thou tell me — for the gods know all things —
who of the immortals fetters me here, and has
hindered me from my path, and tell me of my
return, how I may go over the teeming deep.'

"So I spoke, and he straightway made answer,
and said : ' Nay, surely thou oughtest to have made
fair offerings to Zeus and the other gods before
embarking, that with greatest speed thou mightest
have come to thy country, sailing over the wine-
dark sea. For it is not thy fate to see thy friends,
and reach thy well-built house and thy native land,
before that thou hast once more gone to the waters
of Aegyptus, the heaven-fed river, and hast offered
holy hecatombs to the immortal gods who hold
broad heaven. Then at length shall the gods grant

thee the journey thou desirest.'

" So he spoke, and my spirit was broken within
me, for that he bade me go again over the misty
deep to Aegyptus, a long and weary way. Yet even
so I made answer, and said :

" ' All this will I perform, old man, even as thou
dost bid. But come now, tell me this, and declare
it truly. Did all the Achaeans return unscathed in
their ships, all those whom Nestor and I left, as we
set out from Troy ? Or did any perish by a cruel
death on board his ship, or in the arms of his
friends, when he had wound up the skein of war? '

" So I spoke, and he straightway made answer,
and said : ' Son of Atreus, why dost thou question
me of this ? In no wise does it behove thee to know,
or to learn my mind ; nor, methinks, wilt thou long be
free from tears, when thou hast heard all aright.
For many of them were slain, and many were left ;
hut two chieftains alone of the brazen-coated Ach-
aeans perished on their homeward way (as for the
fighting, thou thyself wast there), and one, I ween,
still lives, and is held back on the broad deep.

" ' Aias truly was lost amid his long-oared ships.
Upon the great rocks of Gyrae Poseidon at first
drove him, but saved him from the sea ; and he
would have escaped his doom, hated of Athene
though he was, had he not uttered a boastful word
in great blindness of heart. He declared that it
was in spite of the gods that he had escaped the
great gulf of the sea ; and Poseidon heard his
boastful speech, and straightway took his trident in
his mighty hands, and smote the rock of Gyrae and
clove it in sunder. And one part abode in its place,
but the sundered part fell into the sea, even that on

which Aias sat at the first when his heart was greatly
blinded, and it bore him down into the boundless
surging deep. So there he perished, when he had
drunk the salt water.

" ' But thy brother escaped, indeed, the fates and
shunned them with his hollow ships, for queenly
Hera saved him. But when he was now about to
reach the steep height of Malea, then the storm-
wind caught him up and bore him over the teeming
deep, groaning heavily, to the border of the land, 1
where aforetime Thyestes dwelt, but where now
dwelt Thyestes' son Aegisthus. But when from
hence too a safe return was shewed him, and the
gods changed the course of the wind that it blew
fair, and they reached home, then verily with
rejoicing did Agamemnon set foot on his native
land, and he clasped his land and kissed it, ~al
many were the hot tears that streamed from his
eyes, for welcome to him was the sight of his land.
Now from his place of watch a watchman saw
him, whom guileful Aegisthus took and set there,
promising him as a reward two talents of gold ; and
he had been keeping guard for ayear, lest Agamemnon
should pass by him unseen, and be mindful
furious might. So he went to the palace to bear the
tidings to the shepherd of the people, and Aegisthus
straightway planned a treacherous device. He chose
out twenty men, the best in the land, and set them
to lie in wait, but on the further side of the hall he
bade prepare a feast. Then he went with chariot
and horses to summon Agamemnon, shepherd of the
people, his mind pondering a dastardly deed. So

at this time in Mycenae), we must understand this phrase to
mean the Argolic promontory.

he brought him up all unaware of his doom, and
when he had feasted him he slew him, as one slays
an ox at the stall. And not one of the comrades of
the son of Atreus was left, of all that followed him,
nor one of the men of Aegisthus, but they were all
slain in the halls.'

" So he spoke, and my spirit was broken within me,
and I wept, as I sat on the sands, nor had my heart
any longer desire to live and to behold the light of
the sun. But when I had had my fill of weeping
and writhing, then the unerring old man of the sea
said to me :

" ' No more, son of Atreus, do thou weep long time
thus without ceasing, for in it we shall find no help.
Nay, rather, with all the speed thou canst, strive
that thou mayest come to thy native land, for either
thou wilt find Aegisthus alive, or haply Orestes may
have forestalled thee and slain him, and thou mayest
chance upon his funeral feast.'

"So he spoke, and my heart and spirit were again
warmed with comfort in my breast despite my grief,
and I spoke, and addressed him with winged words :

"'Of these men now I know, but do thou name
the third, who he is that still lives, and is held back
upon the broad sea, or is haply dead. Fain would I
hear, despite my grief.'

"So I spoke, and he straightway made answer,
and said : ' It is the son of Laertes, whose home is in
Ithaca. Him I saw in an island, shedding big tears,
in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who keeps him
there perforce, and he cannot come to his native
land, for he has at hand no ships with oars and no
comrades to send him on his way over the broad

back of the sea. But for thyself, Menelaus, fostered
of Zeus, it is not ordained that thou shouldst die and
meet thy fate in horse-pasturing Argos, but to the
Elysian plain and the bounds of the earth will the
immortals convey thee, where dwells fair-haired
Rhadamanthus, and where life is easiest for men.
No snow is there, nor heavy storm, nor ever rain,
but ever does Ocean send up blasts of the shrill-
blowing West Wind that they may give cooling to
men ; for thou hast Helen to wife, and art in their
eyes the husband of the daughter of Zeus.'

"So saying he plunged beneath the surging sea,
but I went to my ships with my godlike comrades,
and many things did my heart darkly ponder as I
went. But when I had come down to the ship and
to the sea, and we had made ready our supper, and
immortal night had come on, then we lay down to
rest on the shore of the sea. And as soon as early
Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, our ships first of all
we drew down to the bright sea, and set the masts
and the sails in the shapely ships, and the men, too,
went on board and sat down upon the benches, and
sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their
oars. So back again to the waters of Aegyptus, the
heaven-fed river, I sailed, and there moored my
ships and offered hecatombs that bring fulfilment.
But when I had stayed the wrath of the gods that
are forever, I heaped up a mound to Agamemnon,
that his fame might be unquenchable. Then, when
I had made an end of this, I set out for home, and
the immortals gave me a fair wind, and brought me
swiftly to my dear native land. But come now, tarry
in my halls until the eleventh or the twelfth day be
come. Then will I send thee forth with honour and

give thee splendid gifts, three horses and a well-
polislied car; and besides I will give thee a beautiful
cup, that thou mayest pour libations to the immortal
gods, and remember me all thy days."

Then wise Telemachus answered him : " Son of
Atreus, keep me no long time here, for verily for a
year would I be content to sit in thy house, nor
would desire for home or parents come upon me ;
for wondrous is the pleasure I take in listening to
thy tales and thy speech. But even now my comrades
are chafing in sacred Pylos, and thou art keeping me
long time here. And whatsoever gift thou wouldest
give me, let it be some treasure ; but horses will I
not take to Ithaca, but will leave them here for thy-
self to delight in, for thou art lord of a wide plain,
wherein is lotus in abundance, and galingale and
wheat and spelt, and broad-eared white barley. But
in Ithaca there are no widespread courses nor aught
of meadow-land. It is a pasture-land of goats and
pleasanter than one that pastures horses. For not
one of the islands that lean upon the sea is fit for
driving horses, or rich in meadows, and Ithaca least
of all."

So he spoke, and Menelaus, good at the war-cry,
smiled, and stroked him with his hand, and spoke,
and addressed him :

"Thou art of noble blood, dear child, that thou
speakest thus. Therefore will I change these gifts,
for well I may. Of all the gifts that lie stored as
treasures in my house, I will give thee that one
which is fairest and costliest. I will give thee a
well-wrought mixing bowl. All of silver it is, and
with gold are the rims thereof gilded, the work of
Hephaestus ; and the warrior Phaedimus, king of the

king. They drove up sheep, and brought strength-
ening wine, and their wives with beautiful veils sent
them bread. Thus they were busied about the feast
in the halls.

But the wooers in front of the palace of Odysseus
were making merry, throwing the discus and the
javelin in a levelled place, as their wont was, in
insolence of heart ; and Antinous and godlike Eury-
machus were sitting there, the leaders of the wooers,
who in valiance were far the best of all. To them
Noemon, son of Phronius, drew near, and he ques-
tioned Antinous, and spoke, and said :

"Antinous, know we at all in our hearts, or know
we not, when Telemachus will return from sandy
Pylos ? He is gone, taking a ship of mine, and I
have need of her to cross over to spacious Elis,
where I have twelve brood mares, and at the teat
sturdy mules as yet unbroken. Of these I would
fain drive one off and break him in."

So he spoke, and they marvelled at heart, for they
did not deem that Telemachus had gone to Neleian
Pylos, but that he was somewhere there on his lands,
among the flocks or with the swineherd.

Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke to him,
saying : " Tell me the truth ; when did he go, and
what youths went with him ? Were they chosen
youths of Ithaca, or hirelings and slaves of his own ?
Able would he be to accomplish even that. And tell
me this truly, that I may know full well. Was it

perforce and against thy will that he took from thee
the black ship? or didst thou give it him freely of
thine own will, because he besought thee ? "

Then Noemon, son of Phronius, answered him :
" I myself freely gave it him. What else could any
man do, when a man like him, his heart laden with
care, makes entreaty? Hard it were to deny the
gift. The youths that are the noblest in the land
after ourselves, even these have gone with him ; and
among them I noted one going on board as their
leader, Mentor, or a god, who was in all things like
unto Mentor. But at this 1 marvel. I saw goodly
Mentor here yesterday at early dawn ; but at that
time he embarked for Pylos."

So saying he departed to his father's house, but
of those two the proud hearts were angered. The
wooers they straightway made to sit down and cease
from their games ; and among them spoke Antinous,
son of Eupeithes, in displeasure ; and with rage was
his black heart wholly filled, and his eyes were like
blazing fire.

"Out upon him, verily a proud deed has been
insolently brought to pass by Telemachus, even this
journey, and we deemed that he would never see it
accomplished. Forth in despite of all of us here
the lad is gone without more ado, launching a ship,
and choosing the best men in the land. He will
begin by and by to be our bane ; but to his own
undoing may Zeus destroy his might before ever he
reaches the measure of manhood. But come, give
me a swift ship and twenty men, that I may watch in
ambush for him as he passes in the strait between
Ithaca and rugged Samos. Thus shall his voyaging
in search of his father come to a sorry end."

So he spoke, and they all praised his words, and
bade him act. And straightway they rose up and
went to the house of Odysseus.

Now Penelope was no long time without know-
ledge of the plans which the wooers were plotting
in the deep of their hearts ; for the herald Medon
told her, who heard their counsel as he stood without
the court and they within were weaving their plot.
So he went through the hall to bear the tidings to
Penelope ; and as he stepped across the threshold
Penelope spoke to him and said :

" Herald, why have the lordly wooers sent thee
forth ? Was it to tell the handmaids of divine
Odysseus to cease from their tasks, and make ready
a feast for them? Never wooing 1 any more, nor
consorting together elsewhere, may they now feast
here their latest and their last — even ye who are
ever thronging here and wasting much livelihood,
the wealth of wise Telemachus. Surely ye hearkened
not at all in olden days, when ye were children,
when your fathers told what manner of man Odysseus
was among them that begat you, in that he wrought
no wrong in deed or word to any man in the land,
as the wont is of divine kings — one man they hate
and another they love. Yet he never wrought
iniquity at all to any man. But your mind and your
unseemly deeds are plain to see, nor is there in after
davs any gratitude for good deeds done."

Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her : " I
would, O queen, that this were the greatest evil.
But another greater far and more grievous are the
wooers planning, which I pray that the son of Cronos

may never bring to pass. They are minded to slay
Telemachus with the sharp sword on his homeward
way ; for he went in quest of tidings of his father
to sacred Pylos and to goodly Lacedaemon."

So he spoke, and her knees were loosened where
she sat, and her heart melted. Long time she was
speechless, and both her eyes were filled with tears,
and the flow of her voice was checked. But at last
she made answer, and said to him :

" Herald, why is my son gone ? He had no need
to go on board swift-faring ships, which serve men
as horses of the deep, and cross over the wide waters
of the sea. Was it that not even his name should
be left among men ? "

Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her : " I
know not whether some god impelled him, or whether
his own heart was moved to go to Pylos, that he
might learn either of his father's return or what fate
he had met."

So he spoke, and departed through the house of
Odysseus, and on her fell a cloud of soul-consuming
grief, and she had no more the heart to sit upon one
of the many seats that were in the room, but down
upon the threshold of her fair-wrought chamber she
sank, moaning piteously, and round about her wailed
her handmaids, even all that were in the house, both
young and old. Among these with sobs of lament-
ation spoke Penelope :

" Hear me, my friends, for to me the Olympian
has given sorrow above all the women who were
bred and born with me. For long since I lost mv
noble husband of the lion heart, pre-eminent in all
manner of worth among the Danaans, my noble
husband, whose fame is wide through Hellas and

mid-Argos. And now again my well -loved son have
the storm-winds swept away from our halls without
tidings, nor did I hear of his setting forth. Cruel,
that ye are ! Not even you took thought, any one of
you, to rouse me from my couch, though in your
hearts ye knew full well when lie went on board the
hollow black ship. For had I learned that he was
pondering this journey, he should verily have stayed
here, how eager soever to be gone, or he should have
left me dead in the halls. But now let one hasten
to call hither the aged Dolius, my servant, whom my
father gave me or ever I came hither, and who keeps
my garden of many trees, that he may straightway
go and sit by Laertes, and tell him of all these
things. So haply may Laertes weave some plan in
his heart, and go forth and with weeping make his
plea to the people, who are minded to destroy his
race and that of godlike Odysseus."

Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered her :
" Dear lady, thou mayest verily slay me with the
pitiless sword or let me abide in the house, yet will
I not hide my word from thee. I knew all this, and
gave him whatever he bade me, bread and sweet wine.
But he took from me a mighty oath not to tell thee
until at least the twelfth day should come, or thou
shouldst thyself miss him and hear that he was gone,
that thou mightest not mar thy fair flesh with weep-
ing. But now bathe thyself, and take clean raiment
for thy body, and then go up to thy upper chamber
with thy handmaids and pray to Athene, the
daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis ; for she may
then save him even from death. And trouble not a
troubled old man ; for the race of the son of Arceisius
is not, methinks, utterly hated by the blessed gods,

but there shall still be one, I ween, to hold the high-
roofed halls and the rich fields far away."

So she spoke, and lulled Penelope's laments, and
made her eyes to cease from weeping. She then
bathed, and took clean raiment for her body, and
went up to her upper chamber with her handmaids,
and placing barley grains in a basket prayed to
Athene : ,

" Hear me, child of Zeus who bears the aegis,
unwearied one. If ever Odysseus, of many wiles,
burnt to thee in his halls fat thigh-pieces of heifer
or ewe, remember these things now, I pray thee, and
save my dear son, and ward off" from him the wooers
in their evil insolence."

So saying she raised the sacred cry, and the god-
dess heard her prayer. But the wooers broke into
uproar throughout the shadowy halls, and thus
would one of the proud youths speak :

"Aye, verily the queen, wooed of many, is pre-
paring our marriage, nor does she know at all that
death has been made ready for her son."

So would one of them speak ; but they knew
not how these things were to be. And Antinous
addressed their company, and said :

" Good sirs, 1 shun haughty speech of every kind
alike, lest someone report your speech even within
the house. Nay come, in silence thus let us arise and
put into effect our plan which pleased us one and
all at heart."

So he spoke, and chose twenty men that were best,
and they went their way to the swift ship and the

person addressed is acting in some unaccountable or ill-
omened way. Hence the tone varies from angry remonstrance
to gentle expostulation, or even pity.

shore of the sea. The ship first of all they drew
down to the deep water, and set the mast and sail in
the black ship, and fitted the oars in the leathern
thole-straps, all in due order, and spread the white
sail. And proud squires brought them their weapons.
Well out in the roadstead they moored the ship,
and themselves disembarked. There then they took
supper, and waited till evening should come.

But she, the wise Penelope, lay there in her
upper chamber, touching no food, tasting neither
meat nor drink, pondering whether her peerless son
would escape death, or be slain by the insolent
wooers. And even as a lion is seized with fear and
broods amid a throng of men, when they draw their
crafty ring about him, so was she pondering when
sweet 1 sleep came upon her. And she sank back
and slept, and all her joints relaxed.

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, took
other counsel. She made a phantom, and likened
it in form to a woman, iphthime, daughter of
great-hearted Icarius, whom Eumelus wedded, whose
home was in Pherae. And she sent it to the house
of divine Odysseus, to Penelope in the midst of her
wailing and lamenting, to bid her cease from weep-
ing and tearful lamentation. So into the chamber
it passed by the thong of the bolt, and stood above
her head, and spoke to her, and said :

" Sleepest thou, Penelope, thy heart sore stricken ?
Nay, the gods that live at ease suffer thee not to
weep or be distressed, seeing that thy son is yet to
return ; for in no wise is he a sinner in the eyes of
the gods."

1 It seems certain that v^Sv^os has in all cases supplanted
an original F^Sv/j-os = tjSvs. See Buttmann, Lexiloyus, i.
p. 179, and Merry's note here.

THE ODYSSEY, IV. 808-837

Then wise Penelope answered her, as she slumbered
very sweetly at the gates of dreams :

" Why, sister, art thou come hither ? Thou hast
not heretofore been wont to come, for thou dwellest
in a home far away. And thou biddest me cease
from my grief and the many pains that distress me
in mind and heart. Long since I lost my noble
husband of the lion heart, pre-eminent in all manner
of worth among the Danaans, my noble husband
whose fame is wide in Hellas and mid-Argos. And
now again my well-loved son is gone forth in a
hollow ship, a mere child, knowing naught of toils
and the gatherings of men. For him I sorrow even
more than for that other, and tremble for him, and
fear lest aught befall him, whether it be in the land
of the men to whom he is gone, or on the sea. For
many foes are plotting against him, eager to slay
him before he comes back to his native land."

Then the dim phantom answered her, and said :
"Take heart, and be not in thy mind too sore
afraid ; since such a guide goes with him as men
have full often besought to stand by their side, for
she has power, — even Pallas Athene. And she pities
thee in thy sorrow, for she it is that has sent me
forth to tell thee this."

Then again wise Penelope answered her : " If
thou art indeed a god, and hast listened to the
voice of a god, come, tell me, I pray thee, also of
that hapless one, whether he still lives and beholds
the light of the sun, or whether he is already dead
and in the house of Hades."

And the dim phantom answered her, and said :
" Nay, of him I may not speak at length, whether
he be alive or dead ; it is an ill thing to speak



words vain as wind."

So saying the phantom glided away by the bolt
of the door into the breath of the winds. And the
daughter of Icarius started up from sleep, and her
heart was warmed with comfort, that so clear a
vision had sped to her in the darkness x of night.

But the wooers embarked, and sailed over the
watery ways, pondering in their hearts utter murder
for Telemachus. There is a rocky isle in the midst
of the sea, midway between Ithaca and rugged
Samos, Asteris, of no great size, but therein is a
harbour where ships may lie, with an entrance on
either side. There it was that the Achaeans tarried,
lying in wait for Telemachus.

1 The word is of uncertain etymology, and its precise
significance is doubtful.

BOOK V



Now Dawn arose from her couch from beside
lordly Tithonus, to bear light to the immortals and
to mortal men. And the gods were sitting down to
council, and among them Zeus, who thunders on
high, whose might is supreme. To them Athene
was recounting the many woes of Odysseus, as she
called them to mind; for it troubled her that he
abode in the dwelling of the nymph :

" Father Zeus, and ye other blessed gods that are
forever, never henceforward let sceptred king with
a ready heart be kind and gentle, nor let him heed
righteousness in his mind ; but let him ever be
harsh, and work unrighteousness, seeing that no
one remembers divine Odysseus of the people
whose lord he was ; yet gentle was he as a father.
He verily abides in an island suffering grievous
pains, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who keeps
him perforce ; and he cannot return to his own land,
for he has at hand no ships with oars and no com-
rades to send him on his way over the broad back of
the sea. And now again they are minded to slay
his well-loved son on his homeward way ; for he
went in quest of tidings of his father to sacred
Pylos and to goodly Lacedaemon."

Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her,
and said : " My child, what a word has escaped

the barrier of thy teeth ! Didst thou not thyself
devise this plan, that verily Odysseus might take
vengeance on these men at his coming ? But con-
cerning Telemachus, do thou guide him in thy
wisdom, for thou canst, that all unscathed he may
reach his native land, and the wooers may come
back in their ship baffled in their purpose."

He spoke, and said to Hermes, his dear son :
" Hermes, do thou now, seeing that thou art at
other times our messenger, declare to the fair-
tressed nymph our fixed resolve, even the return
of Odysseus of the steadfast heart, that he may
return with guidance neither of gods nor of
mortal men, but that on a stoutly-bound raft, suf-
fering woes, he may come on the twentieth day
to deep-soiled Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians,
who are near of kin to the gods. These shall heartily
shew him all honour, as if he were a god, and shall
send him in a ship to his dear native land, after
giving him stores of bronze and gold and raiment,
more than Odysseus would ever have won for him-
self from Troy, if he had returned unscathed with
his due share of the spoil. For in this wise it is his
fate to see his friends, and reach his high-roofed
house and his native land."

So he spoke, and the messenger, Argeiphontes,
failed not to hearken. Straightway he bound beneath
his feet his beautiful sandals, immortal, golden, which
were wont to bear him over the waters of the sea
and over the boundless land swift as the blasts of
the wind. And he took the wand wherewith he
lulls to sleep the eyes of whom he will, while others
again he awakens even out of slumber. With this
in his hand the strong Argeiphontes Hew. On to

Pieria he stepped from the upper air, and swooped
down upon the sea, and then sped over the wave
like a bird, the cormorant, which in quest of fish
over the dread gulfs of the unresting sea wets its
thick plumage in the brine. In such wise did
Hermes ride upon the multitudinous waves. But
when he had reached the island which lay afar,
then forth from the violet sea he came to land, and
went his way until he came to a great cave, wherein
dwelt the fair-tressed nymph ; and he found her
within. A great fire was burning on the hearth,
and from afar over the isle there was a fragrance
of cleft cedar and juniper, as they burned ; but
she within was singing with a sweet voice as she
went to and fro before the loom, weaving with a
golden shuttle. Round about the cave grew a
luxuriant wood, alder and poplar and sweet-smelling
cypress, wherein birds long of wing were wont to
nest, owls and falcons and sea-crows with chattering
tongues, who ply their business on the sea. And
right there about the hollow cave ran trailing a
garden vine, in pride of its prime, richly laden with
clusters. And fountains four in a row were flowing
with bright water hard by one another, turned one
this way, one that. And round about soft meadows
of violets and parsley were blooming. There even
an immortal, who chanced to come, might gaze and
marvel, and delight his soul ; and there the messenger
Argeiphontes stood and marvelled. But when he
had marvelled in his heart at all things, straightway
he went into the wide cave ; nor did Calypso, the
beautiful goddess, fail to know him, when she saw
him face to face ; for not unknown are the immortal
gods to one another, even though one dwells in a

home far away. But the great-hearted Odysseus
he found not within ; for he sat weeping on the
shore, as his wont h^H been, racking his soul with
tears and groans and griefs, and he would look over
the unresting sea, shedding tears. And Calypso,
the beautiful goddess, questioned Hermes, when
she had made him sit on a bright shining chair :

" Why, pray, Hermes of the golden wand, hast
thou come, an honourable guest and welcome?
Heretofore thou hast not been wont to come. Speak
what is in thy mind ; my heart bids me fulfil it, if
fulfil it 1 can, and it is a thing that hath fulfilment.
But follow me further, that I may set before thee
entertainment."

So saying, the goddess set before him a table
laden with ambrosia, and mixed the ruddy nectar.
So he drank and ate, the messenger Argeiphontes.
But when he had dined and satisfied his soul with food,
then he made answer, and addressed her, saying :

" Thou, a goddess, dost question me, a god, upon my
coming, and I will speak my word truly, since thou
biddest me. It was Zeus who bade me come hither
against my will. Who of his own will would speed
over so great space of salt sea-water, great past
telling? Nor is there at hand any city of mortals
who offer to the gods sacrifice and choice hecatombs.
But it is in no wise possible for any other god to
evade or make void the will of Zeus, who bears the
aegis. He says that there is here with thee a man
most wretched above all those warriors who around
the city of Priam fought for nine years, and in the
tenth year sacked the city and departed homeward.
But on the way they sinned against Athene, and she
sent upon them an evil wind and long waves. There

all the rest of his goodly comrades perished, but as
for him, the wind and the wave, as they bore him,
brought him hither. Him now Zeus bids thee to
send on his way with all speed, for it is not his fate
to perish here far from his friends, but it is still his
lot to see his friends and reach his high-roofed house
and his native land."

So he spoke, and Calypso, the beautiful goddess,
shuddered, and she spoke, and addressed him with
winged words : " Cruel are ye, O ye gods, and quick
to envy above all others, seeing that ye begrudge
goddesses that they should mate with men openly,
if any takes a mortal as her dear bed-fellow. Thus,
when rosy-fingered Dawn took to herself Orion, ye
gods that live at ease begrudged her, till in Ortygia
chaste Artemis of the golden throne assailed him
with her gentle 1 shafts and slew him. Thus too,
when fair-tressed Demeter, yielding to her passion,
lay in love with Iasion in the thrice-ploughed fallow
land, Zeus was not long without knowledge thereof,
but smote him with his bright thunder-bolt and slew
him. And even so again do ye now begrudge me,
O ye gods, that a mortal man should abide with me.
Him I saved when he was bestriding the keel and
all alone, for Zeus had smitten his swift ship with
his bright thunder-bolt, and had shattered 2 it in the
midst of the wine-dark sea. There all the rest of
his goodly comrades perished, but as for him, the
wind and the wave, as they bore him, brought him
hither. Him I welcomed kindly and gave him food,

1 The phrase commonly denotes a painless death (so in iii.
280). It is only here used of death sent by a wrathful god
or goddess.

and said that I would make him immortal and age-
less all his days. But since it is in no wise possible
for any other god to evade or make void the will of
Zeus who bears the aegis, let him go his way, if Zeus
thus orders and commands, over the unresting sea.
But it is not I that shall give him convoy, for I have
at hand no ships with oars and no men to send him
on his way over the broad back of the sea. But with
a ready heart will I give him counsel, and will hide
naught, that all unscathed he may return to his
native land."

Then again the messenger Argeiphontes answered
her : " Even so send him forth now, and beware of
the wrath of Zeus, lest haply he wax wroth and visit
his anger upon thee hereafter."

So saying, the strong Argeiphontes departed, and
the queenly nymph went to the great-hearted Odys-
seus, when she had heard the message of Zeus.
Him she found sitting on the shore, and his eyes
were never dry of tears, and his sweet life was
ebbing away, as he longed mournfully for his return,
for the nymph was no longer pleasing in his sight.
By night indeed he would sleep by her side perforce
in the hollow caves, unwilling beside the willing
nymph, but by day he would sit on the rocks and
the sands, racking his soul with tears and groans and
griefs, and he would look over the unresting sea,
shedding tears. Then coming close to him, the
beautiful goddess addressed him :

" Unhappy man, sorrow no longer here, I pray
thee, nor let thy life pine away ; for even now with
a ready heart will I send thee on thy way. Nav,
come, hew with the axe long beams, and make a

broad raft, and fasten upon it cross-planks for a deck
well above it, that it may bear thee over the misty
deep. And I will place therein bread and water and
red wine to satisfy thy heart, to keep hunger from
thee. And I will clothe thee with raiment, and
will send a fair wind behind thee, that all unscathed
thou mayest return to thy native land, if it be the
will of the gods who hold broad heaven ; for they
are mightier than I both to purpose and to fulfil."

So she spoke, and much-enduring goodly Odysseus
shuddered, and he spoke, and addressed her with
winged words : " Some other thing, goddess, art
thou planning in this, and not my sending, seeing
that thou biddest me cross on a raft the great ffulf
of the sea, dread and grievous, over which not even
the shapely, swift-faring ships pass, rejoicing in
the wind of Zeus. But I will not set foot on a raft
in thy despite, unless thou, goddess, wilt bring thy-
self to swear a mighty oath that thou wilt not plot
against me any fresh mischief to my hurt."

So he spoke, but Calypso, the beautiful goddess,
smiled, and stroked him with her hand, and spoke,
and addressed him : " Verily thou art a knave, and
not stunted in wit, that thou hast bethought thee to
utter such a word. Now therefore let earth be wit-
ness to this, and the broad heaven above, and the
down-flowing water of the Styx, which is the greatest
and most dread oath for the blessed gods, that I will
not plot against thee any fresh mischief to thy hurt.
Nay, I have such thoughts in mind, and will give
such counsel, as I should devise for mine own self, if
such need should come on me. For I too have a
mind that is righteous, and the heart in this breast
of mine is not of iron, but hath compassion."

So saying, the beautiful goddess led the way
quickly, and he followed in the footsteps of the
goddess. And they came to the hollow cave, the
goddess and the man, and he sat down upon the
chair from which Hermes had arisen, and the nymph
set before him all manner of food to eat and drink,
of such sort as mortal men eat. But she herself sat
over against divine Odysseus, and before her the
handmaids set ambrosia and nectar. So they put
forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready
before them. But when they had had their fill of
food and drink, Calypso, the beautiful goddess, was
the first to speak, and said :

"Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of
many devices, would'st thou then fare now forthwith
home to thy dear native land ! Yet, even so fare
thee well. Howbeit if in thy heart thou knewest
all the measure of woe it is thy fate to fulfil before
thou comest to thy native land thou wouldest abide
here and keep this house with me, and wouldest be
immortal, for all thy desire to see thy wife for whom
thou longest day by day. Surely not inferior to her
do I declare myself to be either in form or stature,
for in no wise is it seemly that mortal women should
vie with immortals in form or comeliness."

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and
said: "Mighty goddess, be not wroth with me for
this. I know full well of myself that wise Penelope
is meaner to look upon than thou in comeliness and
in stature, for she is a mortal, while thou art immortal
and ageless. But even so I wish and long day by day
to reach my home, and to see the day of my return.
And if again some god shall smite me on the wine-
dark sea, I will endure it, having in my breast a

heart that endures affliction. For ere this I have
suffered much and toiled much amid the waves and
in war ; let this also be added unto that."

So he spoke, and the sun set and darkness came
on. And the two went into the innermost recess of
the hollow cave, and took their joy of love, abiding
each by the other's side.

As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,
straightway Odysseus put on a cloak and a tunic,
and the nymph clothed herself in a long white robe,
finely woven and beautiful, and about her waist she
cast a fair girdle of gold, and on her head a veil
above. Then she set herself to plan the sending of
the great-hearted Odysseus. She gave him a great
axe, well fitted to his hands, an axe of bronze,
sharpened on both sides ; and in it was a beautiful
handle of olive wood, securely fastened ; and there-
after she gave him a polished adze. Then she led
the way to the borders of the island where tall
trees were standing, alder and poplar and fir, reach-
ing to the skies, long dry and'well-seasoned, which
would float for him lightly. But when she had
shewn him where the tall trees grew, Calypso, the
beautiful goddess, returned homewards, but he fell
to cutting timbers, and his work went forward apace.
Twenty trees m all did he fell, and trimmed them
with the axe ; then he cunningly smoothed them all
and made them straight to the line. Meanwhile
Calypso, the beautiful goddess, brought him augers ;
and he bored all the pieces and fitted them to one
another, and with pegs and morticings did he hammer
it together. Wide as a man well-skilled in carpentry
marks out the curve of the hull of a freight-ship,
broad of beam, even so wide did Odysseus make his

raft. And he set up the deck-beams, bolting them
to the close set ribs, and laboured on ; and he
finished the raft with long gunwales. In it he set a
mast and a yard-arm, fitted to it, and furthermore
made him a steering-oar, wherewith to steer. Then he
fenced in the whole from stem to stern with willow
withes to be a defence against the wave, and strewed
much brush thereon. 1 Meanwhile Calypso, the
beautiful goddess, brought him cloth to make him a
sail, and he fashioned that too with skill. And he
made fast in the raft braces and halyards and sheets,
and then with levers 2 forced it down into the bright
sea.

Now the fourth day came and all his work was
done. And on the fifth the beautiful Calypso sent
him on his way from the island after she had bathed
him and clothed him in fragrant raiment. On the
raft the goddess put a skin of dark wine, and another,
a great one, of water, and provisions, too, in a wallet.
Therein she put abundance of dainties to satisfy his
heart, and she sent forth a gentle wind and warm.
Gladly then did goodly Odysseus spread his sail to
the breeze ; and he sat and guided his raft skilfully
with the steering-oar, nor did sleep fall upon his
eyelids, as he watched the Pleiads, and late-setting
Bootes, and the Bear, which men also call the Wain,
which ever circles where it is and watches Orion,
and alone has no part in the baths of Ocean. For
this star Calypso, the beautiful goddess, had bidden
him to keep on the left hand as he sailed over the
sea. For seventeen days then he sailed over the

1 The precise meaning of the phrase is uncertain. The
scholiast assumed that it meant " threw in much ballast," but
this seems impossible. Ameis thinks that the vk-rj was to
afford Odysseus a comfortable bed. 3 Possibly " rollers."

sea, and on the eighteenth appeared the shadowy
mountains of the land of the Phaeacians, where it lay
nearest to him ; and it shewed like unto a shield in
the misty deep.

But the glorious Earth-shaker, as he came back
from the Ethiopians, 1 beheld him from afar, from the
mountains of the Solymi : for Odysseus was seen of
him sailing over the sea; and he waxed the more
wroth in spirit, and shook his head, and thus he
spoke to his own heart :

" Out on it ! Surely the gods have changed their
purpose regarding Odysseus, while I was among the
Ethiopians. And lo, he is near to the land of the
Phaeacians, where it is his fate to escape from the
great bonds of the woe which has come upon him.
Aye, but even yet, methinks, I shall drive him to
surfeit of evil."

So saying, he gathered the clouds, and seizing his
trident in his hands troubled the sea, and roused all
blasts of all manner of winds, and hid with clouds
land and sea alike ; and night rushed down from
heaven. Together the East Wind and the South
Wind dashed, and the fierce-blowing W T est Wind and
the North Wind, born in the bright heaven, rolling
before him a mighty wave. Then were the knees of
Odysseus loosened and his heart melted, and deeplv
moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit :

" Ah me, wretched that I am ! What is to befall
me at the last ? I fear me that verily all that the
goddess said was true, when she declared that on the
sea, before ever I came to my native land, I should
fill up my measure of woes ; and lo, all this now is
being brought to pass. In such wise does Zeus over-
cast the broad heaven with clouds, and has stirred

up the sea, and the blasts of all manner of winds
sweep upon me ; now is my utter destruction sure.
Thrice blessed those Danaans, aye, four times blessed,
who of old perished in the wide land of Troy, doing
the pleasure of the sons of Atreus. Even so would
that I had died and met my fate on that day when
the throngs of the Trojans hurled upon me bronze-
tipped spears, fighting around the body of the dead
son of Peleus. Then should I have got funeral rites,
and the Achaeans would have spread my fame, but
now by a miserable death was it appointed me to be
cut oft."

Even as thus he spoke the great wave smote him
from on high, rushing upon him with terrible might,
and around it whirled his raft. Far from the raft he
fell, and let fall the steering-oar from his hand ; but
his mast was broken in the midst by the fierce blast
of tumultuous winds that came upon it, and far in
the sea sail and yard arm fell. As for him, long time
did the wave hold him in the depths, nor could he
rise at once from beneath the onrush of the mighty
wave, for the garments which beautiful Calypso had
given him weighed him down. At length, how-
ever, he came up, and spat forth from his mouth
the bitter brine which flowed in streams from his
head. Yet even so he did not forget his raft, in evil
case though he was, but sprang after it amid the
waves, and laid hold of it, and sat down in the midst
of it, seeking to escape the doom of death ; and a
great wave ever bore the raft this way and that along
its course. As when in autumn the North Wind bears
the thistle-tufts over the plain, and close they cling
to one another, so did the winds bear the raft this

way and that over the sea. Now the South Wind
would fling it to the North Wind to be driven on,
and now again the East Wind would yield it to the
West Wind to drive.

But the daughter of Cadmus, Ino of the fair
ankles, saw him, even Leucothea, who of old was a
mortal of human speech, but now in the deeps of the
sea has won a share of honour from the gods. She
was touched with pity for Odysseus, as he wandered
and was in sore travail, and she rose up from the
deep like a sea-mew on the wing, and sat on the
stoutly-bound raft, and spoke, saying :

" Unhappy man, how is it that Poseidon, the earth-
shaker, has conceived such furious wrath against
thee, that he is sowing for thee the seeds of many
evils ? Yet verily he shall not utterly destroy thee
for all his rage. Nay, do thou thus ; and methinks
thou dost not lack understanding. Strip off these
garments, and leave thy raft to be driven by the
winds, but do thou swim with thy hands and so
strive to reach the land of the Phaeacians, where it is
thy fate to escape. Come, take this veil, and stretch
it beneath thy breast. It is immortal ; there is no
fear that thou shalt suffer aught or perish. But
when with thy hands thou hast laid hold of the land,
loose it from thee, and cast it into the wine-dark sea
far from the land, and thyself turn away."

So saying, the goddess gave him the veil, and
herself plunged again into the surging deep, like a
sea-mew ; and the dark wave hid her. Then the
much-enduring, goodly Odysseus pondered, and
deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit :

" Woe is me ! Let it not be that some one of the
immortals is again weaving a snare for me, that she

bids me leave my raft. Nay, but verily I will not
yet obey, for afar off mine eyes beheld the land,
where she said 1 was to escape. But this will I
do, and meseems that this is best : as long as the
timbers hold firm in their fastenings, so long will
I remain here and endure to suffer affliction ; but
when the wave shall have shattered the raft to
pieces, I will swim, seeing that there is naught
better to devise."

While he pondered thus in mind and heart, Posei-
don, the earth-shaker, made to rise up a great wave,
dread and grievous, arching over from above, and
drove it upon him. And as when a strong wind
tosses a heap of straw that is dry, and some it scat-
ters here, some there, even so the wave scattered
the lonir timbers of the raft. But Odvsseus bestrode
one plank, as though he were riding a horse, and
stripped off the garments which beautiful Calypso
had given him. Then straightway he stretched the
veil beneath his breast, and flung himself headlong
into the sea with hands outstretched, ready to swim.
And the lord, the earth-shaker, saw him, and he
shook his head, and thus he spoke to his own
heart :

"So now, after thou hast suffered many ills, go
wandering over the deep, till thou comest among
the folk fostered of Zeus. Yet even so, methinks,
thou shalt not make any mock at thy suffering."

So saving, he lashed his fair-maned horses, and
came to Aegae, where is his glorious palace.

But Athene, daughter of Zeus, took other counsel.
She stayed the paths of the other winds, and bade
them all cease and be lulled to rest ; but she roused
the swift North Wind, and broke the waves before

him, to the end that Zeus-born Odysseus might come
among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar, escaping
from death and the fates.

Then for two nights and two days he was driven
about over the swollen waves, and full often his heart
forboded destruction. But when fair-tressed Dawn
brought to its birth the third day, then the wind
ceased and there was a windless calm, and he caught
sight of the shore close at hand, casting a quick
glance forward, as he was raised up by a great wave.
And even as when most welcome to his children
appears the life of a father who lies in sickness,
bearing grievous pains, long while wasting away, and
some cruel god assails him, but then to their joy
the gods free him from his woe, so to Odysseus did
the land and the wood seem welcome ; and he swam
on, eager to set foot on the land. But when he was
as far away as a man's voice carries when he shouts,
and heard the boom of the sea upon the reefs — for
the great wave thundered against the dry land,
belching upon it in terrible fashion, and all things
were wrapped in the foam of the sea ; for there were
neither harbours where ships might ride, nor road-
steads, but projecting headlands, and reefs, and cliffs
— then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and his
heart melted, and deeply moved he spoke to his own
mighty spirit :

"Ah me, when Zeus has at length granted me to see
the land beyond my hopes, and lo, I have prevailed
to cleave my way and to cross tins gulf, nowhere
doth there appear a way to come forth from the grey
sea. For without are sharp crags, and around them
the wave roars foaming, and the rock runs up sheer,
and the water is deep close in shore, so that in no

wise is it possible to plant both feet firmly and escape
ruin. Haply were I to seek to land, a great wave
may seize me and dash me against the jagged rock,
and so shall my striving be in vain. But if I swim
on yet further in hope to find shelving beaches ] and
harbours of the sea, I fear me lest the storm-wind
may catch me up again, and bear me, groaning
heavily, over the teeming deep ; or lest some god
may even send forth upon me some great monster
from out the sea — and many such does glorious
Amphitrite breed. For I know that the glorious
Earth-shaker is filled with wrath against me."

While he pondered thus in mind and heart, a great
wave bore him against the rugged shore. There
would his skin have been stripped off and his bones
broken, had not the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene,
put a thought in his mind. On he rushed and seized
the rock with both hands, and clung to it, groaning,
until the great wave went by. Thus then did he
escape this wave, but in its backward flow it once
more rushed upon him and smote him, and flung him
far out in the sea. And just as, when a cuttlefish is
dragged from its hole, many pebbles cling to its
suckers, even so from his strong hands were bits of
skin stripped off against the rocks ; and the great
wave covered him. Then verily would hapless Odys-
seus have perished beyond his fate, had not flashing-
eyed Athene given him prudence. Making his way
forth from the surge where it belched upon the
shore, he swam outside, looking ever toward the
land in hope to find shelving beaches and harbours
of the sea. But when, as he swam, he came to the
mouth of a fair-flowing river, where seemed to him

1 Possibly "shores that take the waves aslant."

the best place, since it was smooth of stones, and
besides there was shelter from the wind, he knew
the river as he flowed forth, and prayed to him in
his heart :

" Hear me, O king, whosoever thou art. As to
one greatly longed-for ! do I come to thee, seeking
to escape from out the sea from the threats of
Poseidon. Reverend even in the eyes of the im-
mortal gods is that man who comes as a wanderer,
even as I have now come to thy stream and to
thy knees, after many toils. Nay, pity me, O king,
for I declare that I am thy suppliant."

So he spoke, and the god straightway stayed his
stream, and checked the waves, and made a calm
before him, and brought him safely to the mouth of
the river. And he let his two knees bend and his
strong hands fall, for his spirit was crushed by the
sea. And all his flesh was swollen, and sea water
flowed in streams up through his mouth and nostrils.
So he lay breathless and speechless, with scarce
strength to move ; for terrible weariness had come
upon him. But when he revived, and his spirit re-
turned again into his breast, then he loosed from him
the veil of the goddess and let it fall into the river
that murmured seaward ; and the great wave bore it
back down the stream, and straightway Ino received
it in her hands. But Odysseus, going back from the
river, sank down in the reeds and kissed the earth,
the giver of grain ; and deeply moved he spoke to
his own mighty spirit :

"Ah, woe is me! what is to befall me? What
will happen to me at the last? If here in the river
bed I keep watch throughout the weary night, I fear

1 Or, " to whom many prayers are made."

that together the bitter frost and the fresh dew may
overcome me, when from feebleness I have breathed
forth my spirit ; and the breeze from the river blows
cold in the early morning. But if I climb up the
slope to the shady wood and lie down to rest in the
thick brushwood, in the hope that the cold and
weariness might leave me, and if sweet sleep comes
over me, I fear me lest I become a prey and spoil
to wild beasts."

Then, as he pondered, this thing seemed to him
the better : he went his way to the wood and found
it near the water in a clear space ; and he crept
beneath two bushes that grew from the same spot,
one of thorn and one of olive. Through these the
strength of the wet winds could never blow, nor the
rays of the bright sun beat, nor could the rain pierce
through them, so closely did they grow, intertwining
one with the other. Beneath these Odysseus crept
and straightway gathered with his hands a broad
bed, for fallen leaves were there in plenty, enough
to shelter two men or three in winter time, however
bitter the weather. And the much-enduring goodly
Odysseus saw it, and was glad, and he lay down in
the midst, and heaped over him the fallen leaves.
And as a man hides a brand beneath the dark
embers in an outlying farm, a man who has no neigh-
bours, and so saves a seed of fire, that he may not
have to kindle it from some other source, so Odysseus
covered himself with leaves. And Athene shed sleep
upon his eyes, that it ought enfold his lids and
speedily free him from toilsome weariness.

BOOK VI



So he lay there asleep, the much-enduring goodly
Odysseus, overcome with sleep and weariness ; but
Athene went to the land and city of the Phaeacians.
These dwelt of old in spacious Hypereia hard by the
Cyclopes, men overweening in pride who plundered
them continually and were mightier than they.
From thence Nausithous, the godlike, had removed
them, and led and settled them in Scheria far from
men that live by toil. About the city he had drawn
a wall, he had built houses and made temples for
the gods, and divided the ploughlands ; but he, ere
now, had been stricken by fate and had gone to the
house of Hades, and Alcinous was now king, made
wise in counsel by the gods. To his house went
the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, to contrive the
return of great-hearted Odysseus. She went to a
chamber, richly wrought, wherein slept a maiden
like the immortal goddesses in form and comeliness,
Nausicaa, the daughter of great-hearted Alcinous ;
hard by slept two hand-maidens, gifted with beauty
by the Graces, one on either side of the door-posts,
and the bright doors were shut.

But like a breath of air the goddess sped to the
couch of the maiden, and stood above her head, and
spoke to her, taking the form of the daughter of
Dymas, famed for his ships, a girl who was of like

age with Nausicaa, and was dear to her heart.
Likening herself to her, the flashing-eyed Athene
spoke and said :

" Nausicaa, how comes it that thy mother bore
thee so heedless? Thy bright raiment is lying un-
cared for ; yet thy marriage is near at hand, when
thou must needs thyself be clad in fair garments,
and give other such to those who escort thee. It is
from things like these, thou knowest, that good
report goeth up among men, and the father and
honoured mother rejoice. Nay, come, let us go to
wash them at break of day, for I will follow with
thee to aid thee, that thou mayest with speed make
thee ready ; for thou shalt not long remain a maiden.
Even now thou hast suitors in the land, the noblest
of all the Phaeacians, from whom is thine own line-
age. Nay, come, bestir thy noble father early this
morning that he make ready mules and a waggon
for thee, to bear the girdles and robes and bright
coverlets. And for thyself, too, it is far more seemly
to go thus than on foot, for the washing tanks are
far from the city."

So saying, the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene,
departed to Olympus, where, they say, is the abode
of the gods that stands fast forever. Neither is it
shaken by winds nor ever wet with rain, nor does
snow fall upon it, but the air is outspread clear and
cloudless, and over it hovers a radiant whiteness.
Therein the blessed gods are glad all their days, and
thither went the flashing-eyed one, when she had
spoken all her word to the maiden.

At once then came fair-throned pawn and awakened
Nausicaa of the beautiful, robes, and straightway she
marvelled at her dreaui, and went through the lipase

to tell her parents, her father dear and her mother ;
and she found them both within. The mother sat
at the hearth with her handmaidens, spinning the
yarn of purple dye, and her father she met as he was
going forth to join the glorious kings in the place of
council, to which the lordly Phaeacians called him.
But she came up close to her dear father, and said :

" Papa dear, wilt thou not make ready for me a
waggon, high and stout of wheel, that I may take to
the river for washing the goodly raiment of mine
which is lying here soiled ? Moreover for thyself it
is seemly that when thou art at council with the
princes thou shouldst have clean raiment upon thee ;
and thou hast five sons living in thy halls — two are
wedded, but three are sturdy bachelors — and these
ever wish to put on them freshly-washed raiment,
when they go to the dance. Of all this must I take
thought."

So she spoke, for she was ashamed to name glad-
some x marriage to her father ; but he understood all,
and answered, saying : " Neither the mules do I be-
grudge thee, my child, nor aught beside. Go thy
way ; the slaves shall make ready for thee the
waggon, high and stout of wheel and fitted with a
box above." 2

With this he called to the slaves, and they
hearkened. Outside the palace they made ready the
light-running mule waggon, and led up the mules and
yoked them to it ; and the maiden brought from her
chamber the bright raiment, and placed it upon the
polished car, while her mother put in a chest food of

1 Possibly "fruitful"; cf. xx. 74; II. ii. 53.

2 Presumably with a body above the running-gear, not
a mere $l<ppos. Others assume that virepreplT] denotes an

all sorts to satisfy the heart. Therein she put dain-
ties, and poured wine in a goat-skin flask ; and the
maiden mounted upon the waggon. Her mother
gave her also soft olive oil in a flask of gold, that she
and her maidens might have it for the bath. Then
Nausieaa took the whip and the bright reins, and
smote the mules to start them ; and there was a
clatter of the mules as they sped on amain, bearing
the raiment and the maiden ; neither went she alone,
for with her went her handmaids as well.

Now when they came to the beautiful streams of the
river, where were the washing tanks that never failed
— for abundant clear water welled up from beneath
and flowed over, to cleanse garments however soiled
— there they loosed the mules from under the wag-
gon and drove them along the eddying river to graze
on the honey-sweet water-grass, and themselves took
in their arms the raiment from the waggon, and bore
it into the dark water, and trampled it in the trenches,
busily vying each with each. Now when they had
washed the garments, and had cleansed them of all
the stains, they spread them out in rows on the shore
of the sea where the waves dashing against the land
washed the pebbles cleanest; and they, after they
had bathed and anointed themselves richly with oil,
took their meal on the river's banks, and waited for
the clothing to dry in the bright sunshine. Then
when they had had their joy of food, she and her
handmaids, they threw off their head-gear and fell to
playing at ball, and white-armed Nausieaa was leader
in the song. 1 And even as Artemis, the archer, roves
over the mountains, along the ridges of lofty Taygetus
or Eiymanthus, joying in the pursuit of boars and

1 They sing while tossing the ball to one another.

swift deer, and with her sport the wood-nymphs, the
daughters of Zeus who hears the aegis, and Leto is
glad at heart— high above them all Artemis holds
her head and brows, and easily may she be known,
though all are fair — so amid her handmaidens shone
the maid unwed.

But when she was about to yoke the mules, and
fold the fair raiment, in order to return homeward,
then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, took other
counsel, that Odysseus might awake and see the fair-
faced maid, who should lead him to the city of the
Phaeacians. So then the princess tossed the ball to
one of her maidens ; the maiden indeed she missed,
but cast it into a deep eddy, and thereat they cried
aloud, and goodly Odysseus awoke, and sat up, and
thus he pondered in mind and heart :

" Woe is me ! to the land of what mortals am I
now come ? Are they cruel, and wild, and unjust ?
or do they love strangers and fear the gods in their
thoughts ? There rang in my ears a cry as of
maidens, of nymphs who haunt the towering peaks
of the mountains, the springs that feed the rivers,
and the grassy meadows ! Can it be that I am some-
where near men of human speech ? Nay, I will
myself make trial and see."

So saying the goodly Odysseus came forth from
beneath the bushes, and with his stout hand he
broke from the thick wood a leafy branch, that he
might hold it about him and hide therewith his
nakedness. Forth he came like a mountain-nurtured
lion trusting in his might, who goes forth, beaten
with rain and wind, but his two eyes are ablaze :
into the midst of the kine he goes, or of the sheep,
or on the track of the wild deer, and his belly bids

him go even into the close-built fold, to make an
attack upon the flocks. Even so Odysseus was about
to enter the company of the fair-tressed maidens,
naked though he was, for need had come upon him.
But terrible did he seem to them, all befouled with
brine, and they shrank in fear, one here, one there,
along the jutting sand-spits. Alone the daughter of
Alcinous kept her place, for in her heart Athene put

courage, and took fear from her limbs. She fled not,
but stood and faced him ; and Odysseus pondered
whether he should clasp the knees of the fair-faced
maid, and make his prayer, or whether, standing
apart as he was, he should beseech her with gentle
words, in hope that she might show him the city
and give him raiment. And, as he pondered, it
seemed to him better to stand apart and beseech her
with gentle words, lest the maiden's heart should be
wroth with him if he clasped her knees ; so straight-
way he spoke a gentle word and crafty :

" I beseech thee, O queen, — a goddess art .,thou,
or art thou mortal ? If -thou art a goddess, one
of those who hold broad heaven, to Artemis, the
daughter of great Zeus, do I liken thee most nearly
in comeliness and in stature and in form. But if
thou art one of mortals who dwell upon the earth,
thrice-blessed then are thy father and thy honoured
mother, and thrice-blessed thy brethren. Full well,
I ween, are their hearts ever warmed with joy
because of thee, as they see thee entering the
dance, a plant 1 so fair. But he again is blessed in
heart above all others, who shall prevail with his
gifts of wooing and lead thee to his home. For

"That our sons may be as plants"; and Isaiah v. 7, "For
the vinej-anl of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel, and
the men of Judah his pleasant plant."

THE ODYSSEY, VI. 160-185

never yet have mine eyes looked upon a mortal
such as thou, whether man or woman ; amazement
holds me as I look on thee. Of a truth in Delos
once I saw such a thing, a young shoot of a palm
springing up beside the altar of Apollo — for thither,
too, I went, and much people followed with me,
on that journey on which evil woes were to be
my portion ; — even so, when I saw that, I marvelled
long at heart, for never yet did such a tree spring
up from the earth. And in like manner, lady, do
I marvel at thee, and am amazed, and fear greatly
to touch thy knees ; but sore grief has come upon
me. Yesterday, on the twentieth day, I escaped
from the wine-dark sea, but ever until then the
wave and the swift winds bore me from the island
of Ogygia ; and now fate has cast me ashore here,
that here too, haply, I may suffer some ill. For not
yet, methinks, will my troubles cease, but the gods
ere that will bring many to pass. Nay, O queen,
have pity ; for it is to thee first that I am come after
many grievous toils, and of the others who possess
this city and land I know not one. Shew me the
city, and give me some rag to throw about me, if
thou hadst any wrapping for the clothes when
thou earnest hither. And for thyself, may the
gods grant thee all that thy heart desires ; a
husband and a home may they grant thee, and
oneness of heart — a goodly gift. For nothing is
greater or better than this, ~\7hen man and wife
dwell in a home in one accord, a great grief to their
foes and a joy to their friends ; but they know it ]
best themselves."

1 Lit. "they hear." This use of k\vw is quite without
parallel.

Then white-armed Nausicaa answered him :
" Stranger, since thou seemest to be neither an
evil man nor a witless, and it is Zeus himself, the
Olympian, that gives happy fortune to men, both to
the good and the evil, to each man as he will ; so
to thee, I ween, he has given this lot, and thou
must in any case endure it. But now, since thou
hast come to our city and land, thou shalt not lack
clothing or aught else of those things which befit
a sore-tried suppliant when he cometh in the way.
The city will I shew thee, and will tell thee the
•name of the people. The Phaeacians possess this city
and land, and I am the daughter of great-hearted
Alcinous, upon whom depend the might and power
of the Phaeacians."

She spoke, and called to her fair-tressed hand-
maids : " Stand, my maidens. Whither do ye flee
at the sight of a man ? Ye do not think, surely,
that he is an enemy ? That mortal man lives not,
or exists 1 nor shall ever be born who shall come
to the land of the Phaeacians as a foeman, for we
are very dear to the immortals. Far off we dwell in
the surging sea, the furthermost of men, and no other
mortals have dealings with us. Nay, this is some
hapless wanderer that has come hither. Him must
we now tend ; for from Zeus are all strangers and
beggars, and a gift, though small, is welcome.
Come, then, my maidens, give to the stranger food
and drink, and bathe him in the river in a spot
where there is shelter from the wind."

So she spoke, and they halted and called to each
other. Then they set Odysseus in a sheltered

1 The doubtful word StepSs is here taken to mean " living "
(Aristarchus, d (iHv). In ix. 43 Siepy must be a different
word.

place, as Nausicaa, the daughter of great-hearted
Alcinous, bade, and beside him they put a cloak and
a tunic for raiment, and gave him soft olive oil in the
flask of gold, and bade him bathe in the streams
of the river. Then among the maidens spoke goodly
Odysseus : " Maidens, stand yonder apart, that by
myself I may wash the brine from my shoulders,
and anoint myself with olive oil ; for of a truth it
is long since oil came near my skin. But in your
presence will I not bathe, for I am ashamed to make
me naked in the midst of fair-tressed maidens."

So he said, and they went apart and told the
princess. But with water from the river goodly
Odysseus washed from his skin the brine which
clothed his back and broad shoulders, and from
his head he wiped the scurf of the unresting sea.
But when he had washed his whole body and
anointed himself with oil, and had put on him the
raiment which the unwedded maid had given him,
then Athene, the daughter of Zeus, made him taller
to look upon and mightier, and from his head she
made the locks to flow in curls like unto the hyacinth
flower. And as when a man overlays silver with
gold, a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and
Pallas Athene have taught all manner of craft, and
full of grace is the work he produces, even so the
goddess shed grace upon his head and shoulders.
Then he went apart and sat down on the shore of
the sea, gleaming with beauty and grace ; and the
damsel marvelled at him, and spoke to her fair-
tressed handmaids, saying :

" Listen," white-armed maidens, that I may say
somewhat. Not without the will of all the gods
who hold Olympus does this man come among the

godlike Phaeacians. Before he seemed to me un-
couth, but now he is like the gods, who hold broad
heaven. Would that a man such as he might be
called my husband, dwelling here, and that it might
please him here to remain. But come, my maidens ;
give to the stranger food and drink."

So she spoke, and they readily hearkened and
obeyed, and set before Odysseus food and drink.
Then verily did the much-enduring goodly Odysseus
drink and eat, ravenously ; for long had he been
without taste of food.

But the white-armed Nausicaa took other counsel.
She folded the raiment and put it in the fair waggon,
and yoked the stout-hoofed mules, and mounted the
car herself. Then she hailed Odysseus, and spoke
and addressed him : " Rouse thee now, stranger, to
go to the city, that I may escort thee to the house
of my wise father, where, I tell thee, thou shalt
come to know all the noblest of the Phaeacians.
Only do thou thus, and, methinks, thou dost not
lack understanding : so long as we are passing
through the country and the tilled fields of men
go thou quickly with the handmaids behind the
mules and the waggon, and I will lead the way.
But when we are about to enter the city, around
which runs a lofty wall, — a fair harbour lies on either
side of the city and the entrance is narrow, and
curved ships are drawn up along the road, for they
all have stations for their ships, each man one for
himself. There, too, is their place of assembly about
the fair temple of Poseidon, fitted with huge 1 stones
set deep in the earth. Here the men are busied

with the tackle of their black ships, with cables and
sails, and here they shape the thin oar-blades. For
the Phaeacians care not for bow or quiver, but for
masts and oars of ships, and for the shapely ships,
rejoicing in which they cross over the grey sea. It
is their ungentle speech that I shun, lest hereafter
some man should taunt me, for indeed there are
insolent folk in the land, and thus might some
baser fellow say, should he meet us : ' Who is this
that follows Nausicaa, a comely man and tall, a
stranger? Where did she find him? He will
doubtless be a husband for her. Haply she has
brought from his ship some wanderer of a folk that
dwell afar — for none are near us — or some god,
long prayed-for, has come down from heaven in
answer to her prayers, and she will have him as her
husband all her days. Better so, even if she has
herself gone forth and found a husband from another
people ; for of a truth she scorns the Phaeacians here
in the land, where she has wooers many and noble ! '
So will they say, and this would become a reproach
to me. Yea, I would myself blame another maiden
who should do such thing, and in despite of her
dear father and mother, while yet they live, should
consort with men before the day of open marriage.
Nay, stranger, do thou quickly hearken to my words,
that with all speed thou may est win from my father
an escort and a return to thy land. Thou wilt find
a goodly grove of Athene hard by the road, a grove
of poplar trees. In it a spring wells up, and round
about is a meadow. There is my father's park and
fruitful vineyard, as far from the city as a man's
voice carries when he shouts. Sit thou down there,
and wait for a time, until we come to the city and

reach the house of my father. But when thou
thinkest that we have reached the house, then do
thou go to the city of the Phaeacians and ask for
the house of my father, great-hearted Alcinous.
Easily may it be known, and a child could guide
thee, a mere babe ; for the houses of the Phaeacians
are no wise built of such sort as is the palace of the
lord Alcinous. But when the house and the court
enclose thee, pass quickly through the great hall,
till thou comest to my mother, who sits at the hearth
in the light of the fire, spinning the purple yarn, a
wonder to behold, leaning against a pillar, and her
handmaids sit behind her. There, too, leaning against
the selfsame pillar, is set the throne of my father,
whereon he sits and quaffs his wine, like unto an
immortal. Him pass thou by, and cast thy hands
about my mother's knees, that thou mayest quickly
see with rejoicing the day of thy return, though
thou art come from never so far. If in her sight
thou dost win favour, then there is hope that thou
wilt see thy friends, and return to thy well-built house
and unto thy native land."

So saying, she smote the mules with the shining
whip, and they quickly left the streams of the river.
Well did they trot, well did they ply their ambling
feet, 1 and she drove with care that the maidens and
Odysseus might follow on foot, and with judgment
did she ply the lash. Then the sun set, and they
came to the glorious grove, sacred to Athene. There
Odysseus sat him down, and straightway prayed to
the daughter of great Zeus : " Hear me, child of aegis-
bearing Zeus, unwearied one. Hearken now to my
prayer, since aforetime thou didst not hearken wlfen

So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard
him ; but she did not yet appear to him face to
face, for she feared her father's brother ; but he
furiously raged against godlike Odysseus, until at
length he reached his own land.

BOOK VII

So he prayed there, the much-enduring goodly
Odysseus, while the two strong mules bore the
maiden to the city. But when she had come to
the glorious palace of her father, she halted the
mules at the outer gate, and her brothers thronged
about her, men like the immortals, and loosed the
mules from the waggon, and bore the raiment
within ; and she herself went to her chamber. There
a fire was kindled for her by her waiting-woman,
Eurymedusa, an aged dame from Apeire. Long ago
the curved ships had brought her from Apeire, and
men had chosen her from the spoil as a gift of
honour for Alcinous, for that he was king over all
the Phaeacians, and the people hearkened to him
as to a god. She it was who had reared the white-
armed Nausicaa in the palace, and she it was who
kindled the fire for her, and made ready her supper
in the chamber.

Then Odysseus roused himself to go to the city,
and Athene, with kindly purpose, cast about him
a thick mist, that no one of the great-hearted
Phaeacians, meeting him, should speak mockingly
to him, and ask him who he was. But when he
was about to enter the lovely city, then the goddess,
flashing-eyed Athene, met him in the guise of a
young maiden carrying a pitcher, and she stood before
him ; and goodly Odysseus questioned her, saying :

THE ODYSSEY, VII. 22-48

" My child, couldst thou not guide me to the
house of him they call Alcinous, who is lord among
the people here ? For I am come hither a stranger
sore-tried from afar, from a distant country ; where-
fore I know no one of the people who possess this
city and land."

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, answered
him : " Then verily, Sir stranger, I will shew thee
the palace as thou dost bid me, for it lies hard
by the house of my own noble father. Only go
thou quietly, and I will lead the way. But turn not
thine eyes upon any man nor question any, for the
men here endure not stranger-folk, nor do they give
kindly welcome to him who comes from another
land. They, indeed, trusting in the speed of their
swift ships, cross over the great gulf of the sea,
for this the Earth-shaker has granted them ; and
their ships are swift as a bird on the wing or as
a thought."

So speaking, Pallas Athene led the way quickly,
and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess.
And as he went through the city in the midst of
them, the Phaeacians, famed for their ships, took
no heed of him, for fair-tressed Athene, the dread
goddess, would not suffer it, but shed about him
a wondrous mist, for her heart was kind toward him.
And Odysseus marvelled at the harbours and the
stately ships, at the meeting-places where the heroes
themselves gathered, and the walls, long and high
and crowned with palisades, a wonder to behold.
But when they had come to the glorious palace of
the king, the goddess, flashing-eyed Athene, was
the first to speak, saying :

" Here, Sir stranger, is the house which thou

didst bid me shew to thee, and thou wilt find the
kings, fostered of Zeus, feasting at the banquet. Go
thou within, and let thy heart fear nothing ; for a
bold man is better in all things, though he be a
stranger from another land. The queen shalt thou
approach first in the palace ; Arete is the name by
which she is called, and she is sprung from the same
line as is the king Alcinous. Nausithous at the first
was born from the earth-shaker Poseidon and Peri-
boea, the comeliest of women, youngest daughter ot
great-hearted Eurymedon, who once was king over
the insolent Giants. But he brought destruction
on his froward people, and was himself destroyed.
But with Periboea lay Poseidon and begat a son, ,
great-hearted Nausithous, who ruled over the Phae-
acians ; and Nausithous begat Rhexenor and Alcinous.
Rhexenor, when as yet he had no son, Apollo of the
silver bow smote in his hall, a bridegroom though
he was, and he left only one daughter, Arete. Her
Alcinous made his wife, and honoured her as no
other woman on earth is honoured, of all those who
in these days direct their households in subjection
to their husbands ; so heartily is she honoured, and
has ever been, by her children and by Alcinous
himself and by the people, who look upon her as upon
a goddess, and greet her as she goes through the
city. For she of herself is no wise lacking in good
understanding, and for the women 1 to whom she
has good will she makes an end of strife even
among their husbands. If in her sight thou dost
win favour, then there is hope that thou wilt see thy
friends, and return to thy high-roofed house and unto
thy native land."

1 Or, reading olai, "settles the quarrels of those to whom
she lias good will, even though they be men."

So saying, flashing-eyed Athene departed over
the unresting sea, and left lovely Scheria. She
came to Marathon and broad-wayed Athens, and
entered the well-built house of Erectheus ; J but
Odysseus went to the glorious palace of Alcinous.
There he stood, and his heart pondered much before
he reached the threshold of bronze ; for there was
a gleam as of sun or moon over the high-roofed
house of great-hearted Alcinous. Of bronze were
the walls that stretched this way and that from the
threshold to the innermost chamber, and around
was a cornice of cyanus. 2 Golden were the doors
that shut in the well-built house, and doorposts
of silver were set in a threshold of bronze. Of
silver was the lintel above, and of gold the handle.
On either side of the door there stood gold and
silver dogs, which Hephaestus had fashioned with
cunning skill to guard the palace of great-hearted
Alcinous ; immortal were they and ageless all their
davs. 3 Within, seats were fixed along the wall on
either hand, from the threshold to the innermost
chamber, and on them were thrown robes of soft
fabric, cunningly woven, the handiwork of women.
On these the leaders of the Phaeacians were wont
to sit drinking and eating, for they had unfailing
store. And golden youths stood on well-built
pedestals, holding lighted torches in their hands
to give light by night to the banqueters in the hall.
And fifty slave-women he had in the house, of
whom some grind the yellow grain on the mill-
stone, and others weave webs, or, as' they sit, twirl

* The dogs, though wrought of gold and silver, are
thought of as alive. The Phaeaciana dwell in fairy-
land.

and from the closely-woven linen the soft olive oil
drips down. 2 For as the Phaeacian men are skilled
above all others in speeding a swift ship upon the sea,
so are the women cunning workers at the loom, for
Athene has given to them above all others skill
in fair handiwork, and an understanding heart.
But without the courtyard, hard by the door, is a
great orchard of four acres, 3 and a hedge runs about
it on either side. Therein grow trees, tall and
luxuriant, pears and pomegranates and apple-trees
with their bright fruit, and sweet figs, and luxuriant
olives. Of these the fruit perishes not nor fails in
winter or in summer, but lasts throughout the year ;
and ever does the west wind, as it blows, quicken to
life some fruits, and ripen others ; pear upon pear
waxes ripe, apple upon apple, cluster upon cluster,
and fig upon fig. There, too, is his fruitful vine-
yard planted, one part of which, a warm spot on
level ground, is being dried in the sun, while other
grapes men are gathering, and others, too, they are
treading ; but in front are unripe grapes that are
shedding the blossom, and others that are turning
purple. There again, by the last row of the vines,
grow trim garden beds of every sort, blooming the
year through, and therein are two springs, one of
which sends its water throughout all the garden,
while the other, over against it, flows beneath the
threshold of the court toward the high house ; from
this the townsfolk drew their water. Such were the
glorious gifts of the gods in the palace of Alcinous.

the linen is so closely woven that oil will not soak through it.

There the much-enduring goodly Odysseus stood
and gazed. But when he had marvelled in his heart
at all things, he passed quickly over the threshold
into the house. There he found the leaders and
counsellors of the Phaeacians pouring libations from
their cups to the keen-sighted Argeiphontes, to
whom they were wont to pour the wine last of all,
when they were minded to go to their rest. But
the much-enduring goodly Odysseus went through
the hall, wrapped in the thick mist which Athene
had shed about him, till he came to Arete and to
Alcinous the king. About the knees of Arete
Odysseus cast his hands, and straightway the
wondrous mist melted from him, and a hush fell
upon all that were in the room at sight of the man,
and they marvelled as they looked upon him. But
Odysseus made his prayer :

" Arete, daughter of godlike Rhexenor, to thy
husband and to thy knees am I come after many
toils, — aye and to these banqueters, to whom may
the gods grant happiness in life, and may each of
them hand down to his children the wealth in his
halls, and the dues of honour which the people have
given him. But for me do ye speed my sending,
that 1 may come to my native land, and that
quickly ; for long time have I been suffering woes
far from my friends."

So saying he sat down on the hearth in the ashes
by the fire, and they were all hushed in silence.
But at length there spoke among them the old lord
Echeneiis, who was an elder among the Phaeacians,
well skilled in speech, and understanding all the
wisdom of old. He with good intent addressed the
assembly, and said : " Alcinous, lo, this is not the

better way, nor is it seemly, that a stranger should
sit upon the ground on the hearth in the ashes ;
but these others hold back waiting for thy word.
Come, make the stranger to arise, and set him upon
a silver-studded chair, and bid the heralds mix wine,
that we may pour libations also to Zeus, who hurls
the thunderbolt ; for he ever attends upon reverend
suppliants. And let the housewife give supper to
the stranger of the store that is in the house."

When the strong and mighty Alcinous heard this,
he took by the hand Odysseus, the wise and crafty-
minded, and raised him from the hearth, and set
him upon a bright chair from which he bade his
son, the kindly 1 Laodamas, to rise ; for he sat next to
him, and was his best beloved. Then a handmaid
brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold,
and poured it over a silver basin, for him to wash,
and beside him drew up a polished table. And
the grave housewife brought and set before him
bread, and therewith dainties in abundance, giving
freely of her store. So the much-enduring goodly
Odysseus drank and ate ; and then the mighty
Alcinous spoke to the herald, and said :

" Pontonous, mix the bowl, and serve wine to all
in the hall, that we may pour libations also to Zeus,
who hurls the thunderbolt ; for he ever attends upon
reverend suppliants."

He spoke, and Pontonous mixed the honey-
hearted wine, and served out to all, pouring first
drops for libation into the cups. But when they
had poured libations, and had drunk to their heart's
content, Alcinous addressed the assembly, and
spoke among them :

1 The word ia commonly rendered " valiant."

THE ODYSSEY, VII. 186-216

" Hearken to me, leaders and counsellors of the
Phaeaeians, that I may say what the heart in my
breast bids me. Now that ye have finished your
feast, go each of you to his house to rest. But in
the morning we will call more of the elders together,
and will entertain the stranger in our halls and offer
goodly victims to the gods. After that we will take
thought also of his sending, that without toil or
pain yon stranger may under our sending, come to his
native land speedily and with rejoicing, though he
come from never so far. Nor shall he meanwhile
suffer any evil or harm, until he sets foot upon his
own land ; but thereafter he shall suffer whatever
Fate and the dread Spinners spun with their thread
for him at his birth, when his mother bore him. But
if he is one of the immortals come down from heaven,
then is this some new thing which the gods are
planning ; for ever heretofore have they been wont
to appear to us in manifest form, when we sacrifice
to them glorious hecatombs, and they feast among
us, sitting even where we sit. Aye, and if one of
us as a lone wayfarer meets them, they use no con-
cealment, for we are of near kin to them, as are the
Cyclopes and the wild tribes of the Giants."

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and
said : " Alcinous, far from thee be that thought ;
for I am not like the immortals, who hold broad
heaven, either in stature or in form, but like mortal
men. Whomsoever ye know among men who
bear greatest burden of woe, to them might I liken
myself in my sorrows. Yea, and I could tell a yet
longer tale of all the evils which I have endured by
the will of the gods. But as for me, suffer me now
to eat, despite my grief; for there is nothing more

shameless than a hateful belly, which bids a man
perforce take thought thereof, be he never so sore
distressed and laden with grief at heart, even as
I, too, am laden with grief at heart, yet ever does
my belly bid me eat and drink, and makes me forget
all that I have suffered, and commands me to eat
my fill. But do ye make haste at break of day,
that ye may set me, hapless one, on the soil of my
native land, even after my many woes. Yea, let
life leave me, when I have seen once more my
possessions, my slaves, and my great high-roofed
house."

So he spoke, and they all praised his words, and
bade send the stranger on his way, since he had
spoken fittingly. Then when they had poured
libations, and had drunk to their heart's content,
they went each man to his home, to take their rest,
and goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall,
and beside him sat Arete and godlike Alcinous ; and
the handmaids cleared away the dishes of the feast.
Then white-armed Arete was the first to speak ; for,
as she saw it, she knew his fair raiment, the mantle
and tunic, which she herself had wrought with her
handmaids. And she spoke, and addressed him
with winged words :

" Stranger, this question will I myself ask thee
first. Who art thou among men, and from whence ?
Who gave thee this raiment ? Didst thou not say
that thou earnest hither wandering over the sea ? "

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and
said : " Hard were it, O queen, to tell to the end
the tale of my woes, since full many have the
heavenly gods given me. But this will I tell thee,
of which thou dost ask and enquire. There is an

isle, Ogygia, which lies far off in the sea. Therein
dwells the fair-tressed daughter of Atlas, guileful
Calypso, a dread goddess, and with her no one either
of gods or mortals hath aught to do ; but me in my
wretchedness did fate bring to her hearth alone,
for Zeus had smitten my swift ship with his bright
thunderbolt, and had shattered it in the midst of
the wine-dark sea. There all the rest of my trusty
comrades perished, but I clasped in my arms the
keel of my curved ship and was borne drifting for
nine days, and on the tenth black night the gods
brought me to the isle, Ogygia, where the fair-
tressed Calypso dwells, a dread goddess. She took
me to her home with kindly welcome, and gave me
food, and said that she would make me immortal
and ageless all my days ; but she could never per-
suade the heart in my breast. There for seven years'
space I remained continually, and ever with my tears
would I wet the immortal raiment which Calypso
gave me. But when the eighth year came in circling
course, then she roused me and bade me go, either be-
cause of some message from Zeus, or because her own
mind was turned. And she sent me on my way on
a raft, stoutly bound, and gave me abundant store ot
bread and sweet wine, and clad me in immortal
raiment, and sent forth a gentle wind and warm.
So for seventeen days I sailed over the sea, and on
the eighteenth appeared the shadowy mountains of
your land ; and my heart was glad, ill starred that I
was ; for verily I was yet to have fellowship with
great woe, which Poseidon, the earth-shaker, sent
upon me. For he stirred up the winds against me and
stayed my course, and wondrously roused the sea,

nor would the wave suffer me to be borne upon my ,
raft, as I groaned ceaselessly. My raft indeed the
storm shattered, but by swimming I clove my way
through yon gulf of the sea, until the wind and the
waves, as they bore me, brought me to your shores.
There, had I sought to land, the waves would have
hurled me upon the shore, and dashed me against
the great crags and a cheerless place, but I gave
way, and swam back until I came to a river, where
seemed to me the best place, since it was smooth of
rocks, and besides there was shelter from the wind.
Forth then I staggered, and sank down, gasping for
breath, and immortal night came on. Then I went
forth from the heaven-fed river, and lay down to
sleep in the bushes, gathering leaves about me ; and
a god shed over me infinite sleep. So there among
the leaves I slept, my heart sore stricken, the whole
night through, until the morning and until midday ;
and the sun turned to his setting 1 ere sweet sleep
released me. Then I saw the handmaids of thy
daughter on the shore at play, and amid them was
she, fair as the goddesses. To her I made my
prayer ; and she in no wise failed in good under-
standing, to do as thou wouldst not deem that one
of younger years would do on meeting thee ; for
younger folk are ever thoughtless. She gave bread
in plenty and flaming wine, and bathed me in the
river, and gave me this raiment. In this, for all my
sorrows, have I told thee the truth."

Then in turn Alcinous answered him, and said :
" Stranger, verily my daughter was not minded

1 In thus rendering St/Aero I have attempted to meet the
difficulty that most of the events recorded in Book VI. occur
in the interval between the waking of Odysseus and the
actual setting of the sun. Hence 5v<t(to is impossible.

aright in this, that she did not bring thee to our
house with her maidens. Yet it was to her first that
thou didst make thy prayer."

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and
said : " Prince, rebuke not for this, I pray thee, thy
blameless daughter. She did indeed bid me follow
with her maidens, but I would not for fear and
shame, lest haply thy heart should darken with
wrath as thou sawest it ; for we are quick to anger,
we tribes of men upon the earth."

And again Alcinous answered him, and said :
" Stranger, not such is the heart in my breast, to
be filled with wrath without a cause. Better is due
measure in all things. I would, O father Zeus, and
Athene and Apollo, that thou, so goodly a man, and
like-minded with me, wouldst have my daughter to
wife, and be called my son, and abide here ; a house
and possessions would I give thee, if thou shouldst
choose to remain, but against thy will shall no one of
the Phaeacians keep thee ; let not that be the will
of father Zeus. But as for thy sending, that thou
mayest know it surely, I appoint a time thereto,
even the morrow. Then shalt thou lie down, over-
come by sleep, and they shall row thee over the
calm sea until thou comest to thy country and thy
house, or to whatsoever place thou wilt, aye though
it be even far beyond Euboea, which those of our
people who saw it, when they carried fair-haired
Ilhadamanthus to visit Tityus, the son of Gaea, say
is the furthest of lands. Thither they went, and
without toil accomplished their journey, and on the
selfsame day came back home. So shalt thou, too,
know for thyself how far my ships are the best, and
my youths at tossing the brine with the oar-blade."

So said he, and the much - enduring goodly
Odysseus was glad ; and he spoke in prayer, and
said : " Father Zeus, grant that Alcinous may bring
to pass all that he has said. So shall his fame be
unquenchable over the earth, the giver of grain,
and I shall reach my native land."

Thus they spoke to one another, and white-armed
Arete bade her maidens place a bedstead under
cover of the portico, and to lay on it fair blankets of
purple, and to spread thereover coverlets, and on
these to put fleecy cloaks for clothing. So they
went forth from the hall with torches in their hands.
But when they had busily spread the stout-built
bedstead, they came to Odysseus, and called to him,
and said : " Rouse thee now, stranger, to go to thy
rest; thy bed is made."

Thus they spoke, and welcome did it seem to him
to lay him down to sleep. So there he slept, the
much-enduring goodly Odysseus, on the corded
bedstead under the echoing portico. But Alcinous
lay down in the inmost chamber of the lofty house,
and beside him lay the lady his wife, who had
strewn the couch.

BOOK VIII



As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,
the strong and mighty Aleinous rose from his couch,
and up rose also Zeus-born Odysseus, the sacker of
cities. And the strong and mighty Aleinous led the
way to the place of assembly of the Phaeacians,
which was builded for them hard by their ships.
Thither they came and sat down on the polished
stones close by one another ; and Pallas Athene went
throughout the city, in the likeness of the herald of
wise Aleinous, devising a return for great-hearted
Odysseus. To each man's side she came, and spoke
and said :

" Hither now, leaders and counsellors of the Phae-
acians, come to the place of assembly, that you may
learn of the stranger who has newly come to the
palace of wise Aleinous after his wanderings over
the sea, and in form is like unto the immortals."

So saying she roused the spirit and heart of each
man, and speedily the place of assembly and the
seats were filled with men that gathered. And many
marvelled at the sight of the wise son of Laertes, for
wondrous was the grace that Athene shed upon his
head and shoulders ; and she made him taller and
sturdier to behold, that he might be welcomed by all
the Phaeacians, and win awe and reverence, and
might accomplish the many feats wherein the Phaea-
cians made trial of Odysseus. Now when they were

assembled and met together, Alcinous addressed
their assembly and spoke among them :

" Hearken to me, leaders and counsellors of the
Phaeacians, that I may speak what the heart in my
breast bids me. This stranger — I know not who he
is — has come to my house in his wanderings, whether
from men of the east or of the west. He urges
that he be sent on his way, and prays for assur-
ance, and let us on our part, as of old we were wont,
speed on his sending ; for verily no man soever
who comes to my house, abides here long in sorrow
for lack of sending. Nav come, let us draw a black
ship down to the bright sea for her first voyage, and
let men choose two and fifty youths from out the
people, even those that have heretofore been the
best. And when you have all duly lashed the oars
to the thole-pins, 1 go ashore, and then go your way
to my house, and prepare a feast with speed ; and I
will provide bountifully for all. To the youths this
is my command, but do you others, the sceptred
kings, come to my fair palace, that we may entertain
yon stranger in the halls; and let no man say me
nay. And summon hither the divine minstrel,
Demodocus ; for to him above all others has the god
granted skill in song, to give delight in whatever
way his spirit prompts him to sing."

So saying, he led the way, and the sceptred kings
followed him, while a herald went for the divine
minstrel. And chosen youths, two and fifty, went,
as he bade, to the shore of the unresting sea. And
when they had come down to the ship and to the
sea, they drew the black ship down to the deep
water, and placed the mast and sail in the black

1 Or " rowing-benches," as commonly.

ship, and fitted the oars in the leathern thole-straps,
all in due order, and spread the white sail. Well
out in the roadstead they moored the ship, and then
went their way to the great palace of the wise Alci-
nous. Filled were the porticoes and courts and rooms
with the men that gathered, for many there were,
both young and old. For them Alcinous slaughtered
twelve sheep, and eight white-tusked boars, and two
oxen of shambling gait. These they flayed and
dressed, and made ready a goodly feast.

Then the herald drew near, leading the good
minstrel, whom the Muse loved above all other men,
and gave him both good and evil ; of his sight she
deprived him, but gave him the gift of sweet song.
For him Pontonous, the herald, set a silver-studded
chair in the midst of the banqueters, leaning it
against a tall pillar, and he hung the clear-toned
lyre from a peg close above his head, and showed
him how to reach it with his hands. And beside
him he placed a basket and a beautiful table, and a
cup of wine, to drink when his heart should bid him.
So they put forth their hands to the good cheer _
lying ready before them. But when they had put
from them the desire of food and drink, the Muse
moved the minstrel to sing of the glorious deeds of
warriors, from that lay the fame whereof had then
reached broad heaven, even the quarrel of Odysseus
and Achilles, son of Peleus, how once they strove
with furious words at a rich feast of the gods, and
Agamemnon, king of men, was glad at heart that
the best of the Achaeans were quarrelling ; for thus
Phoebus Apollo, in giving his response, had told him
that it should be, in sacred Pytho, when he passed
over the threshold of stone to enquire of the oracle.

THE ODYSSEY, VIII. 81-109

For then the beginning of woe was rolling upon
Trojans and Danaans through the will of great Zeus.

This song the famous minstrel sang ; but Odysseus
grasped his great purple cloak with his stout hands,
and drew it down over his head, and hid his comely
face ; for he had shame of the Phaeacians as he let
fall tears from beneath his eyebrows. Yea, and as
often as the divine minstrel ceased his singing,
Odysseus would wipe away his tears and draw the
cloak from off his head, and taking the two-handled
cup would pour libations to the gods. But as often
as he began again, and the nobles of the Phaeacians
bade him sing, because they took pleasure in his lay,
Odysseus would again cover his head and moan.
Now from all the rest he concealed the tears that he
shed, but Alcinous alone marked him and took heed,
for he sat by him, and heard him groaning heavily.
And straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians,
lovers of the oar :

"Hear me, ye leaders and counsellors of the Phae-
acians, already have we satisfied our hearts with the
equal banquet and with the lyre, which is the com-
panion of the rich feast. But now let us go forth,
and make trial of all manner of games, that yon
stranger may tell his friends, when he returns home,
how far we excel other men in boxing and wrestling-
and leaping and in speed of foot."

So saying, he led the way, and they followed him.
From the peg the herald hung the clear-toned lyre,
and took Demodocus by the hand, and led him forth
from the hall, guiding him by the self-same road by
which the others, the nobles of the Phaeacians, had
gone to gaze upon the games. They went their way
to the place of assembly, and with them went a

rendered : " The course was stretched (laid out) from the

great throng, past counting ; and up rose many noble
youths. There rose Acroneiis, and Ocyalus, and Ela-
treus, and Nauteus, and Prymneus, and Anchialus,
and Eretmeus, and Ponteus, and Proreus, Thoon and
Anabesineiis, and Amphialus, son of Polyneiis, son of
Tecton ; and up rose also Euryalus, the peer of man-
destroying Ares, the son of Naubolus, who in come-
liness and form was the best of all the Phaeacians
after peerless Laodamas ; and up rose the three sons
of noble Alcinous, Laodamas, and Halius, and god-
like Clytoneiis. These then first made trial in the
foot-race : a course was marked out for them from
the turning point, 1 and they all sped swiftly, raising
the dust of the plain ; but among them noble Clyto-
neiis was far the best at running, and by as far as is
the range 2 of a team of mules in fallow land, by so
far he shot to the front and reached the host, and
the others were left behind. Then they made trial
of toilsome wrestling, and here in turn Euryalus
excelled all the princes. And in leaping Amphialus
was best of all, and with the discus again far the
best of all was Elatreus, and in boxing Laodamas,
the good son of Alcinous. But when the hearts of
all had taken pleasure in the contests, Laodamas,
the son of Alcinous, spoke among them :

" Come, friends, let us ask yon stranger whether
he knows and has learned any contests. In build,
surely, he is no mean man, in thighs and calves, and
in his two arms above, his stout neck, and his great
might. In no wise does he lack aught of the
strength of youth, but he has been broken by many

starting-point," or " From the start their running wa3
strained to the utmost.''

2 The word probably denotes the length of the furrow cut
before a turn was made.

troubles. For to my mind there is naught worse
than the sea to confound a man, be he never so
strong."

And Euryalus in turn answered him, and said:
" Laodamas, this word of thine is right fitly spoken.
Go now thyself and challenge him, and make known
thy word."

Now when the good son of Alcinous heard this he
came and took his stand in the midst and spoke to
Odysseus : " Come, Sir stranger, do thou, too, make
trial of the contests, if thou knowest any ; and it
must he that thou knowest contests, for there is no
greater glory for a man so long as he lives than that
which he achieves by his own hands and his feet. Nay,
come, make trial, and cast away care frdm thy heart.
Thy journey shall no more be long delayed, nay,
even now thy ship is launched and the crew is
ready."

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and
said : " Laodamas, why do ye mock me with this
challenge ? Sorrow is in my mind far more than
contests, seeing that in time past I have suffered
much and toiled much, and now I sit in the midst
of your assembly, longing for my return home, and
making my prayer to the king and to all the people."

Then again Eurvalus made answer and taunted
him to his face : " Nay verily, stranger, for I do not
liken thee to a man that is skilled in contests, such
as abound among men, but to one who, faring to and
fro with his benched ship, is a captain of sailors who
are merchantmen, one who is mindful of his freight,
and has charge of a home-borne cargo, and the
gains of his greed. Thou dost not look like an
athlete."

Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows
Odysseus of many wiles answered him : " Stranger,
thou hast not spoken well ; thou art as one blind with
folly. So true is it that the gods do not give gracious
gifts to all alike, not form nor mind nor eloquence.
For one man is inferior in comeliness, but the god
sets a crown 1 of beauty upon his words, and men
look upon him with delight, and he speaks on un-
falteringly with sweet modesty, and is conspicuous
among the gathered people, and as he goes through
the city men gaze upon him as upon a god. Another
again is in comeliness like the immortals, but no
crown of grace is set about his words. So, in thy
case, thy comeliness is preeminent, nor could a
god himself mend it, but in mind thou art stunted.
Thou hast stirred the spirit in my breast by speaking
thus unmannerly. I am not unskilled in sports as
thou pratest, nay, methinks I was among the first so
long as I trusted in my youth and in my hands.
But now I am bound by suffering and pains ; for
much have I endured in passing through wars of
men and the grievous waves. But even so, though
I have suffered much, I will make trial of the
contests, for thy word has stung me to the heart,
and thou hast provoked me with thy speech."

He spoke, and, leaping up with his cloak about
him as it was, seized a discus larger than the rest
and thick, no little heavier than those with which
the Phaeacians were wont to contend one with
another. This with a whirl he sent from his stout
hand, and the stone hummed as it flew ; and down
they crouched to the earth, the Phaeacians of the

long oars, men famed for their ships, beneath the
rush of the stone. Past the marks of all it flew,
speeding lightly from his hand, and Athene, in the
likeness of a man, set the mark, and she spoke and
addressed him :

"Even a blind man, stranger, could distinguish
this mark, groping for it with his hands, for it is in no
wise confused with the throng of the others, but is
far the first. Be thou of good cheer for this bout
at least: no one of the Phaeacians will reach this, or
cast beyond it."

So she spoke, and the much-enduring goodly
Odysseus was glad, rejoicing that he saw a true
friend in the lists. Then with a lighter heart he
spoke among the Phaeacians :

" Reach this now, young men ; and presently,
methinks, I will send another after it, as far or even
further. Of the rest, if any man's heart and spirit
bid him, let him come hither and make trial — for
ye have greatly angered me — be it in boxing or in
wrestling, aye, or in running, I care not ; let any one
come of all the Phaeacians, save Laodamas alone.
For he is my host, and who would quarrel with one
that entertains him ? Foolish is that man and worth-
less, who challenges to a contest the host who re-
ceives him in a strange land ; he does but mar his
own fortunes. But of all the rest I refuse none, and
make light of none, but am fain to know them, and
make trial of them man to man. For in all things I
am no weakling, even in all the contests that are
practised among men. Well do I know how to
handle the polished bow, and ever would I be the
first to shoot and smite my man in the throng of the
foe, even though many comrades stood by me and

were shooting at the men. Only Philoctetes excelled
me with the bow in the land of the Trojans, when
we Achaeans shot. But of all others I declare that I
am best by far, of all mortals that are now upon the
earth and eat bread. Yet with men of former days
I will not seek to vie, with Heracles or with Eurytus
of Oechalia, who strove even with the immortals in
archery. Wherefore great Eurytus died soon, nor did
old age come upon him in his halls, for Apollo waxed
wroth and slew him, because he had challenged him
to a contest with the bow. And with the spear I
throw farther than any other man can shoot with an
arrow. In the foot race alone I fear that someone of
the Phaeacians may outstrip me, for cruelly have I
been broken amid the many waves, since there was
in my ship no lasting store of provisions ; therefore
my limbs are loosened."

So he spoke and they were all hushed in silence ;
but Alcinous alone answered him and said :

" Stranger, since not ungraciously dost thou speak
thus in our midst, but art minded to shew forth the
prowess which waits upon thee, in anger that yonder
man came up to thee in the lists and taunted thee in
a way in which no mortal would make light of thy
prowess, who knew in his heart how to speak fitly ;
come, now, hearken to my words, that thou mayest
tell to another hero, when in thy halls thou art feast-
ing with thy wife and children, and rememberest our
skill, what feats Zeus has vouchsafed to us from our
fathers' days even until now. For we are not fault-
less boxers or wrestlers, but in the foot race we run
swiftly, and we are the best seamen ; and ever to us
is the banquet dear, and the lyre, and the dance, and
changes of raiment, and warm baths, and the couch.

But come now, all ye that are the best dancers of
the Phaeacians, make sport, that the stranger may
tell his friends on reaching home how far we surpass
others in seamanship and in fleetness of foot, and
in the dance and in song. And let one go straight-
way and fetch for Demodocus the clear-toned lyre
which lies somewhere in our halls."

So spoke Alcinous the godlike, and the herald
rose to fetch the hollow lyre from the palace of the
king. Then stood up masters of the lists, nine in all,
men chosen from out the people, who in their gather-
ings were wont to order all things aright. They
levelled a place for the dance, and marked out a fair
wide ring, and the herald came near, bearing the
clear-toned lyre for Demodocus. He then moved
into the midst, and around him stood bovs in the
first bloom of youth, well skilled in the dance, and
they smote the goodly dancing floor with their feet.
And Odysseus gazed at the twinklings of their feet
and marvelled in spirit.

But the minstrel struck the chords in prelude to his
sweet lay and sang of the love of Ares and Aphrodite
of the fair crown, how first they lay together in the
house of Hephaestus secretly ; and Ares gave her
many gifts, and shamed the bed of the lord Hephaes-
tus. But straightway one came to him with tidings,
even Helius, who had marked them as they lay
together in love. And when Hephaestus heard the
grievous tale, he went his way to his smithy, ponder-
ing evil in the deep of his heart, and set on the
anvil block the great anvil and forged bonds which
might not be broken or loosed, that the lovers 1
might bide fast where they were. But when he had
fashioned the snare in his wrath against Ares, he

went to his chamber where lay his bed, and every-
where round about the bed-posts he spread the
bonds, and many too were hung from above, from the
roof-beams, fine as spiders' webs, so thai no one even
of the blessed gods could see them, so exceeding
craftily were they fashioned. But when he had spread
all his snare about the couch, he made as though he
would go to Lemnos, that well-built citadel, which
is in his eyes far the dearest of all lands. And no
blind watch did Ares of the golden rein keep, when
he saw Hephaestus, famed for his handicraft, depart-
ing, but he went his way to the house of famous
Hephaestus, eager for the love of Cytherea of the
fair crown. Now she had but newly come from the
presence of her father, the mighty son of Cronos,
and had sat her down. And Ares came into the
house and clasped her hand and spoke and addressed
her:

" Come, love, let us to bed and take our joy,
couched together. For Hephaestus is no longer here
in the land, but has now gone, I ween, to Lemnos, to
visit the Sintians of savage speech."

So he spoke, and a welcome thing it seemed to
her to lie with him. So they two went to the couch,
and lay them down to sleep, and about them clung
the cunning bonds of the wise Hephaestus, nor could
they in any wise stir their limbs or raise them up.
Then at length they learned that there was no more
escaping. And near to them came the famous god of
the two strong arms, 1 having turned back before he
reached the land of Lemnos; for Helius had kept
watch for him and had brought him word. So he
went to his house with a heavy heart, and stood at

the gateway, and fierce anger seized him. And
terribly he cried out and called to all the gods:

" Father Zeus, and ye other blessed gods that are
forever, come hither that ye may see a laughable
matter and a monstrous, 1 even how Aphrodite, daugh-
ter of Zeus, scorns me for that I am lame and loves
destructive Ares because he is comely and strong of
limb, whereas I was born misshapen. Yet for this is
none other to blame but my two parents — would
they had never begotten me ! But ye shall see
where these two have gone up into my bed and sleep
together in love ; and I am troubled at the sight.
Yet, methinks, they will not wish to lie longer thus,
no, not for a moment, how loving soever they are.
Soon shall both lose their desire to sleep ; but the
snare and the bonds shall hold them until her father
pays back to me all the gifts of wooing that I gave
him for the sake of his shameless girl ; for his
daughter is fair but bridles not her passion." 2

So he spoke and the gods gathered to the house
of the brazen floor. 3 Poseidon came, the earth-en-
folder, and the helper Hermes came, and the lord
Apollo, the archer god. 4 Now the goddesses abode
for shame each in her own house, but the gods, the
givers of good things, stood in the gateway ; and un-
quenchable laughter arose among the blessed gods
as they saw the craft of wise Hephaestus. And thus
would one speak, with a glance at his neighbour :

" 111 deeds thrive not. The slow catches the swift ;
even as now Hephaestus, slow though he is, has out-

1 Lit. "hard," "unyielding."

2 Others render simply, "lacking in discretion."

3 Or, "with threshold of brass."

4 Or, possibly, "the averter of ills." The word mean9
literally, "he who works afar."

stripped Ares for all that he is the swiftest of the
gods who hold Olympus. Lame though he is, he
has caught him by craft, wherefore Ares owes the
fine of the adulterer."

Thus thev spoke to one another. But to Hermes
the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, said :

" Hermes, son of Zeus, messenger, giver of good
things, wouldst thou in sooth be willing, even though
ensnared with strong bonds, to lie on a couch by the
side of golden Aphrodite?"

Then the messenger, Argeiphontes, answered him :
" Would that this might befall, lord Apollo, thou
archer god — that thrice as many bonds inextricable
might clasp me about and ye gods, aye, and all the
goddesses too might be looking on, but that I might
sleep by the side of golden Aphrodite."

So he spoke and laughter arose among the immortal
gods. Yet Poseidon laughed not, but ever besought
Hephaestus, the famous craftsman, to set Ares free;
and he spoke, and addressed him with winged words :

" Loose him, and I promise, as thou biddest me,
that he shall himself pay thee all that is right in the
presence of the immortal gods."

Then the famous god of the two strong arms
answered him : " Ask not this of me, Poseidon, thou
earth-enfolder. A sorry thing to be sure of is the
surety for a sorry knave. How could I put thee in
bonds among the immortal gods, if Ares should
avoid both the debt and the bonds and depart? "

Then again Poseidon, the earth-shaker, answered
him : " Hephaestus, even if Ares shall avoid the
debt and flee away, I will myself pay thee this."

Then the famous god of the two strong arms

answered him : " It may not be that I should say

thee nay, nor were it seemly."

THE ODYSSEY, VIII. 359-386

So saying the mighty Hephaestus loosed the honds
and the two, when they were freed from that bond
so strong, sprang up straightway. And Ares de-
parted to Thrace, but she, the laughter-loving Aphro-
dite, went to Cyprus, to Paphos, where is her demesne
and fragrant altar. There the Graces bathed her
and anointed her with immortal oil, such as gleams !
upon the gods that are forever. And they clothed
her in lovely raiment, a wonder to behold.

This song the famous minstrel sang ; and Odysseus
was glad at heart as he listened, and so too were
the Phaeacians of the long oars, men famed for
their ships.

Then Alcinous bade Halius and Laodamas dance
alone, for no one could vie with them. And when
they had taken in their hands the beautiful ball
of purple, which wise Polybus had made for them,
the one would lean backward and toss it toward
the shadowy clouds, and the other would leap up
from the earth and skilfully catch it before his feet
touched the ground again. But when they had tried
their skill in throwing the ball straight up, the two
fell to dancing on the bounteous earth, ever tossing
the ball to and fro, and the other youths stood in
the lists and beat time, and thereat a great din arose.

Then to Alcinous spoke goodly Odysseus : " Lord
Alcinous, renowned above all men, 2 thou didst boast
that thy dancers were the best, and lo, thy words
are made good ; amazement holds me as I look on
them."

So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Alcinous
was glad ; and straightway he spoke among the
Phaeacians, lovers of the oar :

1 Or, simply, "decks," "covers."

2 Or, " above all the people."

THE ODYSSEY, VIII. 387-413

" Hear me, leaders and counsellors of the Phae-
aeians. This stranger verily seems to me a man
of understanding. Come then, let us give him a
gift of friendship, as is fitting ; for twelve glorious
kings bear sway in our land as rulers, and I myself
am the thirteenth. Now do you, each of the twelve,
bring a newly washed cloak and tunic, and a talent
of precious gold, and let us straightway bring all
together, that the stranger with our gifts in his
hands may go to his supper glad at heart. And
let Euryalus make amends to the stranger himself
with words and with a gift, for the word that he
spoke was in no wise seemly."

So he spoke, and they all praised his words and
bade that so it should be, and sent forth every man
a herald to fetch the gifts. And Euryalus in turn
made answer, and said :

" Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men, I will
indeed make amends to the stranger, as thou biddest
me. I will give him this sword, all of bronze,
whereon is a hilt of silver, and a scabbard of new-
sawn ivory is wrought about it ; and it shall be to
him a thing of great worth."

So saying, he put into his hands the silver-
studded sword, and spoke, and addressed him with
winged words : " Hail, Sir stranger ; but if any
word has been spoken that was harsh, may the
storm-winds straightway snatch it and bear it away.
And for thyself, may the gods grant thee to see
thy wife, and to come to thy native land, for long
time hast thou been suffering woes far from thy
friends."

And Odysseus of many wiles answered him : " All
hail to thee, too, friend ; and may the gods grant

thee happiness, and mayest thou never hereafter
miss this sword which thou hast given me, making
amends with gentle speech."

He spoke, and about his shoulders hung the silver-
studded sword. And the sun set, and the glorious
gifts were brought him. These the lordly heralds bore
to the palace of Alcinous, and the sons of peerless
Alcinous took the beautiful gifts and set them before
their honoured mother. And the strong and mighty
Alcinous led the way, and they came in and sat
down on the high seats. Then to Arete spoke the
mighty Alcinous :

" Bring hither, wife, a goodly chest, the best thou
hast, and thyself place in it a newly-washed cloak
and tunic ; and do ye heat for the stranger a cauldron
on the fire, and warm water, that when he has
bathed and has seen well bestowed all the gifts
which the noble Phaeacians have brought hither,
he may take pleasure in the feast, and in hearing
the strains of the song. And I will give him this
beautiful cup of mine, wrought of gold, that he
may remember me all his days as he pours liba-
tions in his halls to Zeus and to the other
gods."

So he spoke, and Arete bade her handmaids to
set a great cauldron on the fire with all speed.
And they set on the blazing fire the cauldron for
filling the bath, and poured in water, and took
billets of wood and kindled them beneath it. Then
the fire played about the belly of the cauldron, and
the water grew warm ; but meanwhile Arete brought
forth for the stranger a beautiful chest from the
treasure chamber, and placed in it the goodly gifts,
the raiment and the gold, which the Phaeacians

gave. And therein she herself placed a cloak and
a fair tunic ; and she spoke and addressed Odysseus
with winged words :

" Look now thyself to the lid, and quickly cast
a cord upon it, lest some one despoil thee of thy
goods on the way, when later on a thou art lying in
sweet sleep, as thou farest in the black ship."

Now when the much-enduring goodly Odysseus
heard these words, he straightway fitted on the
lid, and quickly cast a cord upon it— a cunning
knot, which queenly Circe once had taught him.
Then forthwith the housewife bade him go to the
bath and bathe ; and his heart was glad when he
saw the warm bath, for he had not been wont to
have such tendance from the time that he left
the house of faired-haired Calypso, but until then
he had tendance continually as a god.

Now when the handmaids had bathed him and
anointed him with oil, and had cast about him a
fair cloak and a tunic, he came forth from the
bath, and went to join the men at their wine.
And Nausicaa, gifted with beauty by the gods,
stood by the door-post of the well-built hall, and
she marvelled at Odysseus, as her eyes beheld
him, and she spoke, and addressed him with winged
words :

" Farewell, stranger, and hereafter even in thy
own native land mayest thou remember me, for
to me first thou owest the price of thy life."

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her :
" Nausicaa, daughter of great-hearted Alcinous, so
may Zeus grant, the loud-thundering lord of Here,
that I may reach my home and see the day of

my returning. Then will I even there pray to thee
as to a god all my days, for thou, maiden, hast
given me life."

He spoke, and sat down on a chair beside king
Alcinous. And now they were serving out portions
and mixing the wine. Then the herald came near,
leading the good minstrel, Demodocus, held in
honour by the people, and seated him in the midst
of the banqueters, leaning his chair against a high
pillar. Then to the herald said Odysseus of many
wiles, cutting off a portion of the chine of a white-
tusked boar, whereof yet more was left, and there
was rich fat on either side :

" Herald, take and give this portion to Demo-
docus, that he may eat, and I will greet him, despite
my grief. For among all men that are upon the
earth minstrels win honour and reverence, for that
the Muse has taught them the paths of song, and
loves the tribe of minstrels."

So he spoke, and the herald bore the portion
and placed it in the hands of the lord Demodocus,
and he took it and was glad at heart. So they
put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready
before them. But when they had put from them
the desire of food and drink, then to Demodocus
said Odysseus of many wiles :

" Demodocus, verily above all mortal men do I
praise thee, whether it was the Muse, the daughter
of Zeus, that taught thee, or Apollo ; for well and
truly dost thou sing of the fate of the Achaeans,
all that they wrought and suffered, and all the
toils they endured, as though haply thou hadst
thyself been present, or hadst heard the tale from
another. But come now, change thy theme, and

sing of the building of the horse of wood, which
Epeius made with Athene's help, the horse which
once Odysseus led up into the citadel as a thing
of guile, when he had filled it with the men who
sacked Ilios. If thou dost indeed tell me this
tale aright, I will declare to all mankind that the
god has of a ready heart granted thee the gift of
divine song."

So he spoke, and the minstrel, moved by the god,
began, and let his song be heard, taking up the tale
where the Argives had embarked on their benched
ships and were sailing away, after casting fire on
their huts, while those others led by glorious Odys-
seus were now sitting in the place of assembly of the
Trojans, hidden in the horse ; for the Trojans had
themselves dragged it to the citadel. So there it
stood, while the people talked long as they sat about
it, and could form no resolve. Nay, in three ways did
counsel find favour in their minds : either to cleave
the hollow timber with the pitiless bronze, or to drag
it to the height and cast it down the rocks, or to
let it stand as a great offering to propitiate the gods,
even as in the end it was to be brought to pass ; for it
was their fate to perish when their city should enclose
the great horse of wood, wherein were sitting all the
best of the Argives, bearing to the Trojans death and
fate. And he sang how the sons of the Achaeans
poured forth from the horse and, leaving their hollow
ambush, sacked the city. Of the others he sang how
in divers ways they wasted the lofty city, but of
Odysseus, how he went like Ares to the house of
Deiphobus together with godlike Menelaus. There
it was, he said, that Odysseus braved the most terrible
fight and in the end conquered by the aid of great-
hearted Athene.

This song the famous minstrel sang. But the
heart of Odysseus was melted and tears wet his
cheeks beneath his eyelids. And as a woman wails
and flings herself about her dear husband, who has
fallen in front of his city and his people, seeking to
ward off from his city and his children the pitiless
day ; and as she beholds him dying and gasping for
breath, she clings to him and shrieks aloud, while
the foe behind her smite her back- and shoulders
with their spears, and lead her away to captivity to
bear toil and woe, while with most pitiful grief her
cheeks are wasted : even so did Odysseus let fall
pitiful tears from beneath his brows. Now from all
the rest he concealed the tears that he shed, but
Alcinous alone marked him and took heed, for he
sat by him and heard him groaning heavily. And
straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians, lovers
of the oar :

" Hear me, leaders and counsellors of the Phaea-
cians, and let Demodocus now check his clear-toned
lyre, for in no wise to all alike does he give pleasure
with this song. Ever since we began to sup and the
divine minstrel was moved to sing, from that time
yon stranger has never ceased from sorrowful lamen-
tation ; surely, methinks, grief has encompassed his
heart. Nay, let the minstrel cease, that we may all
make merry, hosts and guest alike, since it is better
thus. Lo, for the sake of the honoured stranger all
these things have been made ready, his sending and
the gifts of friendship which we give him of our love.
Dear as a brother is the stranger and the suppliant
to a man whose wits have never so short a range.
Therefore do not thou longer hide with crafty thought
whatever I shall ask thee ; to speak out plainly is

the better course. Tell me the name by which they
were wont to call thee in thy home, even thy mother
and thy father and other folk besides, thy townsmen
and the dwellers round about. For there is no one
of all mankind who is nameless, be he base man or
noble, when once he has been born, but parents bestow
names on all when they give them birth. And tell me
thy country, thy people, and thy city, that our ships
may convey thee thither, discerning the course by
their wits. For the Phaeacians have no pilots, nor
steering-oars such as other ships have, but their ships
of themselves understand the thoughts and minds of
men, and they know the cities and rich fields of all
peoples, and most swiftly do they cross over the gulf
of the sea, hidden in mist and cloud, nor ever have
they fear of hai*m or ruin. Yet this story I once
heard thus told by my father Nausithous, who was
wont to say that Poseidon was wroth with us because
we give safe convoy to all men. He said that some
day, as a well-built ship of the Phaeacians was return-
ing from a convoy over the misty deep, Poseidon
would smite her and would fling a great mountain
about our city. 1 So that old man spoke, and these
things the god will haply bring to pass, or will leave
unfulfilled, as may be his good pleasure. But come,
now, tell me this and declare it truly : whither thou
hast wandered and to what countries of men thou
hast come; tell me of the people and of their well-
built cities, both of those who are cruel and wild and
unjust, and of those who love strangers and fear the
gods in their thoughts. And tell me why thou dost
weep and wail in spirit as thou nearest the doom
of the Argive Danaans and of Ilios. This the gods

BOOK IX

Then Odysseus, of many wiles, answered him, and
said : " Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men,
verily this is a good thing, to listen to a minstrel
such as this man is, like unto the gods in voice. For
myself I declare that there is no greater fulfilment
of delight than when joy possesses a whole people,
and banqueters in the halls listen to a minstrel as
they sit in order due, and by them tables are laden
with bread and meat, and the cup-bearer draws wine
from the bowl and bears it round and pours it into
the cups. This seems to my mind the fairest thing
there is. But thy heart is turned to ask of my
grievous woes, that I may weep and groan the more.
What, then, shall I tell thee first, what last? for woes
full many have the heavenly gods given me. First
now will I tell my name, that ye, too, may know it,
and that I hereafter, when I have escaped from the
pitiless day of doom, may be your host, though I
dwell in a home that is afar. I am Odysseus, son oi
Laertes, who am known among men for all manner
of wiles, 1 and my fame reaches unto heaven. But
I dwell in clear-seen Ithaca, wherein is a mountain,
Neriton, covered with waving forests, conspicuous
from afar ; and round it lie many isles hard by one
another, Dulichium, and Same, and wooded Zacynthus.
1 Or, " who am known among all men for my wiles."

3°4



♦ THE ODYSSEY, IX. 25-47

Ithaca itself lies close in to the mainland 1 the
furthest toward the gloom, 2 but the others lie
apart toward the Dawn and the sun — a rugged isle,
but a good nurse of young men ; and for myself no
other thing can I see sweeter than one's own land.
Of a truth Calypso, the beautiful goddess, sought to
keep me by her in her hollow caves, yearning that I
should be her husband ; and in like manner Circe
would fain have held me back in her halls, the guileful
lady of Aeaea, yearning that I should be her husband ;
but they could never persuade the heart within my
breast. So true is it that naught is sweeter than a
man's own land and his parents, even though it be
in a rich house that he dwells afar in a foreign land
away from his parents. But come, let me tell thee
also of my woeful home-coming, which Zeus laid
upon me as I came from Troy.

" From Ilios the wind bore me and brought me to
the Cicones, to Ismarus. There I sacked the city
and slew the men ; and from the city we took their
wives and great store of treasure, and divided them
among us, that so far as lay in me no man might go
defrauded of an equal share. Then verily I gave
command that we should Hee with swift foot, but the
others in their great folly did not hearken. But
there much wine was drunk, and many sheep they
slew by the shore, and sleek kine of shambling gait.
Meanwhile the Cicones went and called to other

actual facts. It accepts the view that Homer's Ithaca is to
be identified, not with Thiaki, but with Leucas. As com-
monly rendered, the lines convict the poet of an utter
ignorance of the geography of western Greece.

2 That is, from the standpoint of a sailor making his way
up the coast toward the dark and unknown region of the
north and west.

Cicones who were their neighbours, at once more
numerous and braver than they — men that dwelt
inland and were skilled at righting with their foes .
from chariots, and, if need were, on foot. So they
came in the morning, as thick as leaves or Mowers
spring up in their season ; and then it was that an
evil fate from Zeus beset us luckless men, that we
might suffer woes full many. They set their battle
in array and fought by the swift ships, and each side
hurled at the other with bronze-tipped spears. Now
as long as it was morn and the sacred day was
waxing, so long we held our ground and beat them
off, though they were more than we. But when
the sun turned to the time for the unyoking of
oxen, then the Cicones prevailed and routed the
Achaeans, and six of my well-greaved comrades
perished from each ship ; but the rest of us escaped
death and fate.

" Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, glad to
have escaped from death, though we had lost our
dear comrades ; nor did I let my curved ships pass
on till we had called thrice on each of those hapless
comrades of ours who died on the plain, cut down by
the Cicones. But against our ships Zeus, the cloud-
gatherer, roused the North Wind with a wondrous
tempest, and hid with clouds the land and the sea
alike, and night rushed down from heaven. Then
the ships were driven headlong, and their sails were
torn to shreds by the violence of the wind. So we
lowered the sails and stowed them aboard, in fear of
death, and rowed the ships hurriedly toward the land.
There for two nights and two days continuously we
lay, eating our hearts for weariness and sorrow. But

when now fair-tressed Dawn brought to its birth the
third day, we set up the masts and hoisted the white
sails, and took our seats, and the wind and the
helmsmen steered the ships. And now all unscathed
should I have reached my native land, but the wave
and the current and the North Wind beat me back
as I was rounding Malea, and drove me from my
course past Cythera.

" Thence for nine days' space I was borne by dire-
ful winds over the teeming deep ; but on the tenth
we set foot on the land of the Lotus-eaters, who eat
a flowery food. There we went on shore and drew
water, and straightway my comrades took their meal
by the swift ships. But when we had tasted food
and drink, I sent forth some of my comrades to
go and learn who the men were, who here ate bread
upon the earth ; two men I chose, sending with them
a third as a herald. So they went straightway and
mingled with the Lotus-eaters, and the Lotus-eaters
did not plan death for my comrades, but gave them
of the lotus to taste. And whosoever of them ate
of the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus, had no longer
any wish to bring back word or to return, but there
they were fain to abide among the Lotus-eaters, feed-
ing on the lotus, and forgetful of their homeward
way. These men, therefore, I brought back perforce
to the ships, weeping, and dragged them beneath
the benches and bound them fast in the hollow
ships ; and I bade the rest of my trusty comrades to
embark with speed on the swift ships, lest perchance
anyone should eat of the lotus and forget his home-
ward way. So they went on board straightway and
sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in order
smote the grey sea with their oars.

"Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, and we
came to the land of the Cyclopes, an overweening
and lawless folk, who, trusting in the immortal gods,
plant nothing with their hands nor plough ; but all
these things spring up for them without sowing or
ploughing, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear
the rich clusters of wine, and the rain of Zeus gives
them increase. Neither assemblies for council have
they, nor appointed laws, but they dwell on the peaks
of lofty mountains in hollow caves, and each one is
lawgiver to his children and his wives, and they reck
nothing one of another.

" Now there is a level 1 isle that stretches aslant
outside the harbour, neither close to the shore of the
land of the Cyclopes, nor yet far off, a wooded isle.
Therein live wild goats innumerable, for the tread
of men scares them not away, nor are hunters
wont to come thither, men who endure toils in
the woodland as they course over the peaks of
the mountains. Neither with flocks is it held, nor
with ploughed lands, but unsown and unfilled all
the days it knows naught of men, but feeds the
bleating goats. For the Cyclopes have at hand no
ships with vermilion cheeks, 2 nor are there ship-
wrights in their land who might build them well-
benched ships, which should perform all their wants,
passing to the cities of other folk, as men often
cross the sea in ships to visit one another — craftsmen,
who would have made of this isle also a fair settle-
ment. For the isle is nowise poor, but would bear

1 The word is a doubtful one. Others render, "deep-

all things in season. In it are meadows by the shores
of the grey sea, well-watered meadows and soft,
where vines would never fail, and in it level plough-
land, whence they might reap from season to season
harvests exceeding deep, so rich is the soil beneath ;
and in it, too, is a harbour giving safe anchorage,
where there is no need of moorings, either to throw
out anchor-stones or to make fast stern cables, but
one may beach one's ship and wait until the sailors'
minds bid them put out, and the breezes blow fair.
Now at the head of the harbour a spring of bright
water flows forth from beneath a cave, and round
about it poplars grow. Thither we sailed in, and
some god guided us through the murky night; for
there was no light to see, but a mist lay deep about
the ships and the moon showed no light from heaven,
but was shut in by clouds. Then no man's eyes be-
held that island, nor did we see the long waves
rolling on the beach, until we ran our well-benched
ships on shore. And when we had beached the
ships we lowered all the sails and ourselves went
forth on the shore of the sea, and there we fell
asleep andVaited for the bright Dawn.

" As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,
we roamed throughout the isle marvelling at it ; and
the nymphs, the daughters of Zeus who bears the
aegis, roused the mountain goats, that my comrades
might have whereof to make their meal. Straight-
way we took from the ships our curved bows and
long javelins, and arrayed in three bands we fell to
smiting ; and the god soon gave us game to satisfy
our hearts. The ships that followed me were twelve,
and to each nine goats fell by lot, but for me alone
they chose out ten.

"So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting
on abundant flesh and sweet wine. For not yet was
the red wine spent from out our ships, but some was
still left ; for abundant store had we drawn in jars
for each crew when we took the sacred citadel of the
Cicones. And we looked across to the land of the
Cyclopes, who dwelt close at hand, and marked the
smoke, and the voice of men, and of the sheep, and
of the goats. But when the sun set and darkness
came on, then we lay down to rest on the shore of
the sea. And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the
rosy-fingered, I called my men together and spoke
among them all :

" ' Remain here now, all the rest of you, my trusty
comrades, but I with my own ship and my own com-
pany will go and make trial of yonder men, to learn
who they are, whether they are cruel, and wild, and
unjust, or whether they love strangers and fear the
gods in their thoughts.'

'•'So saying, I went on board the ship and bade
my comrades themselves to embark, and to loose the
stern cables. So they went on board straightway
and sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in
order smote the grey sea with their oars. But when
we had reached the place, which lay close at hand,
there on the land's edge hard by the sea we saw a
hiirh cave, roofed over with laurels, and there manv
flocks, sheep and goats alike, were wont to sleep.
Round about it a high court was built with stones
set deep in the earth, and with tall pines and high-
crested oaks. There a monstrous man was wont to
sleep, who shepherded his flocks alone and afar, and
mingled not with others, but lived apart, with his

heart set on lawlessness. For he was fashioned a
wondrous monster, and was not like a man that lives
by bread, but like a wooded peak of lofty mountains,
which stands out to view alone, apart from the rest.

"Then I bade the rest of my trusty comrades to
remain there by the ship and to guard the ship, but
I chose twelve of the best of my comrades and went
my way. With me I had a goat-skin of the dark,
sweet wine, which Maro, son of Euanthes, had given
me, the priest of Apollo, the god who used to watch
over Ismarus. And he had given it me because we
had protected him with his child and wife out of
reverence; for he dwelt in a wooded grove of Phoebus
Apollo. And he gave me splendid gifts : of well-
wrought gold he gave me seven talents, and he gave
me a mixing-bowl all of silver ; and besides these,
wine, wherewith he filled twelve jars in all, wine
sweet and unmixed, a drink divine. Not one of his
slaves nor of the maids in his halls knew thereof,
but himself and his dear wife, and one house-dame
only. And as often as they drank that honey-sweet
red wine he would fill one cup and pour it into
twenty measures of water, and a smell would rise
from the mixing-bowl marvellously sweet; then verily
would one not choose to hold back. With this wine
I filled and took with me a great skin, and also provi-
sion in a scrip ; for my proud spirit had a foreboding
that presently a man would come to me clothed in
great might, a savage man that knew naught of
justice or of law. 1

" Speedily we came to the cave, nor did we find

1 In the Greek both words are plural. The idea is there-
fore not abstract, but concrete, and suggests that " law "
was to the speaker a body of traditional decrees, or dooms.

him within, but he was pasturing his fat flocks in the
fields. So we entered the cave and gazed in wonder
at all things there. The crates were laden with
cheeses, and the pens were crowded with lambs and
kids. Each kind was penned separately : by them-
selves the firstlings, by themselves the later lambs,
and by themselves again the newly yeaned. And
with whey were swimming all the well-wrought
vessels, the milk-pails and the bowls into which he
milked. Then my comrades spoke and besought me
first of all to take of the cheeses and depart, and
thereafter speedily to drive to the swift ship the kids
and lambs from out the pens, and to sail over the
salt water. But I did not listen to them — verily it
would have been better far — to the end that I might
see the man himself, and whether he would give me
gifts of entertainment. Yet, as it fell, his appearing
was not to prove a joy to my comrades.

" Then we kindled a fire and offered sacrifice, and
ourselves, too, took of the cheeses and ate, and thus
we sat in the cave and waited for him until he came
back, herding his flocks. He bore a mighty weight
of dry wood to serve him at supper time, and flung
it down with a crash inside the cave, but we, seized
with terror, shrank back into a recess of the cave.
But he drove his fat flocks into the wide cavern — all
those that he milked ; but the males — the rams and
the goats — he left without in the deep court. 1 Then
he lifted on high and set in place the great door-
stone, a mighty rock ; two and twenty stout four-
wheeled waggons could not lift it from the ground,

1 This rendering takes tKToQtv as an adverb, and Paddys
ai>\ris as a local genitive (see Monro, Homeric Grammar,
§ 149). Otherwise we must change the text here and in 338.

such a towering mass of rock he set in the doorway
Thereafter he sat down and milked the ewes and
bleating goats all in turn, and beneath each dam
he placed her young. Then presently he curdled
half the white milk, and gathered it in wicker baskets
and laid it away, and the other half he set in vessels
that he might have it to take and drink, and that it
might serve him for supper. But when he had busily
performed his tasks, then he i - ekindled the fire, and
caught sight of us, and asked :

" ' Strangers, who are ye ? Whence do ye sail over
the watery ways ? Is it on some business, or do ye
wander at random over the sea, even as pirates, who
wander, hazarding their lives and bringing evil to
men of other lands?'

" So he spoke, and in our breasts our spirit was
broken for terror of his deep voice and monstrous
self; yet even so I made answer and spoke to him,
saving :
{ Q' t We, thou must know, are from Troy, Achaeans,
driven wandering by all manner of winds over the
great gulf of the sea. Seeking our home, we have
come by another way, by other paths ; so, I ween,
Zeus was pleased to devise. And we declare that
we are the men of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, whose
fame is now mightiest under heaven, so great a city
did he sack, and slew many people ; but we on our
part, thus visiting thee, have come as suppliants to
thy knees, in the hope that thou wilt give us enter-
tainment, or in other wisp make some present, as is
the due of strangers. f|Nay, mightiest one, rever-
ence the gods ; we are thy suppliants ; and Zeus
is the avenger of suppliants and strangers — Zeus,
the strangei's' god — who ever attends upon reverend



strangers.

"So I spoke, and he straightway made answer
with pitiless heart : ' A fool art thou, stranger, or art
come from afar, seeing that thou biddest me either to
fear or to shun the gods. For the Cyclopes reck not
of Zeus, who bears the aegis, nor of the blessed gods,
since verily we are better far than they. Nor would
I, to shun the wrath of Zeus, spare either thee or
thy comrades, unless my own heart should bid me.
But tell me where thou "didst moor thy well-wrought
ship on thy coming. Was it haply at a remote part
of the land, or close by ? I fain would know.'

"So he spoke, tempting me, but he trapped me
not because of nly great cunning; and I made answer
again in crafty words :

" ' My ship Poseidon, the earth-shaker, dashed to
pieces, casting her upon the rocks at the border of
your land ; for he brought her close to the headland,
and the wind drove her in from the sea. But 1, with
these men here, escaped utter destruction.'

"So I spoke, but from his pitiless heart he made
no answer, but sprang up and put forth his hands
upon my comrades. Two of them at once he seized
and dashed to the earth like puppies, and the brain
flowed forth upon the ground and wetted the earth.
Then he cut them limb from limb and made ready
his supper, and ate them as a mountain-nurtured
lion, leaving naught — ate the entrails, and the flesh,
and the marrowy bones. And we with wailing held
up our hands to Zeus, beholding his cruel deeds ;
and helplessness possessed our souls. But when the
Cyclops had filled his huge maw by eating human
Mesh and thereafter drinking pure milk, he lay down
within the cave, stretched out among the sheep.
And I formed a plan in my great heart to steal near

him, and draw my sharp sword from beside my thigh
and smite him in the breast, where the midriiF holds
the liver, feeling for the place with my hand. But
a second thought checked me, for right there should
we, too, have perished in utter ruin. For we should
not have been able to thrust back with our hands
from the high door the mighty stone which he had
set there. So then, with wailing, we waited for the
bright Dawn.

"As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,
he rekindled the fire and milked his goodly flocks all
in turn, and beneath each dam placed her young.
Then, when he had busily performed his tasks, again
he seized two men at once and made ready his meal.
And when he had made his meal he drove his fat
flocks forth from the cave, easily moving away the
great door-stone ; and then he put it in place again,
as one might set the lid upon a quiver. Then with
loud whistling the Cyclops turned his fat flocks
toward the mountain, and I was left there, devising
evil in the deep of my heart, if in any way I might
take vengeance on him, and Athene grant me glory.

" Now this seemed to my mind the best plan.
There, lay beside a sheep-pen a great club of the
Cyclops, a staff of green olive-wood, which he had
cut to carry with him when dry ; and as we looked at
it we thought it as large as is the mast of a black
ship of twenty oars, a merchantman, broad of beam,
which crosses over the great gulf; so huge it was in
length and in breadth to look upon. To this I came,
and cut off therefrom about a fathom's length and
handed it to my comrades, bidding them dress it
down ; and they made it smooth, and I, standing by,
sharpened it at the point, and then straightway took

it and hardened it in the blazing fire. Then I laid
it carefully away, hiding it beneath the dung, which
lay in great heaps throughout the cave. And I bade
my comrades cast lots among them, which of them
should have the hardihood with me to lift the stake
and grind it into his eye when sweet sleep should
come upon him. And the lot fell upon those whom
I myself would fain have chosen ; four they were,
and I was numbered with them as the fifth. At even
then he came, herding his flocks of goodly fleece,
and straightway drove into the wide cave his fat
flocks one and all, and left not one without in the
deep court, either from some foreboding or because a
god so bade him. Then he lifted on high and set in
place the great door-stone, and sitting down he milked
the ewes and bleating goats all in turn, and beneath
each dam he placed her young. But when he had
busily performed his tasks, again he seized two men'
at once and made ready his supper. Then I drew
near and spoke to the Cyclops, holding in my hands
an ivy l bowl of the dark wine :

" ' Cyclops, take and drink wine after thy meal of
human flesh, that thou mayest know what manner of
drink this is which our ship contained. It was to
thee that I was bringing it as a drink offering, in the
hope that, touched with pity, thou mightest send me
on my way home ; but thou ragest in a way that is
past all bearing. Cruel man, how shall any one of all
the multitudes of men ever come to thee again here-
after, seeing that thou hast wrought lawlessness ? '

" So I spoke, and he took the cup and drained it,
and was wondrously pleased as he drank the sweet
draught, and asked me for it again a second time :

1 That is, made of ivy wood.

"'Give it me again with a ready heart, and tell
me thy name straightway, that I may give thee a
stranger's gift whereat thou mayest be glad. For
among the Cyclopes the earth, the giver of grain,
bears the rich clusters of wine, and the rain of
Zeus gives them increase ; but this is a streamlet
of ambrosia and nectar.'

"So he spoke, and again I handed him the flaming
wine. Thrice I brought and gave it him, and thrice
he drained it in his folly. But when the wine had
stolen about the wits of the Cyclops, then I spoke
to him with gentle words :

" ' Cyclops, thou askest me of my glorious name,
and I will tell it thee ; and do thou give me a
stranger's gift, even as thou didst promise. Noman
is my name, Noman do they call me — my mother
and my father, and all my comrades as well.'

" So 1 spoke, and he straightway answered me
with pitiless heart : ' Noman will I eat last among
his comrades, and the others before him ; this shall
be thy gift.'

" He spoke, and reeling fell upon his back, and
lay there with his thick neck bent aslant, and sleep,
that conquers all, laid hold on him. And from his
gullet came forth wine and bits of human flesh, and
he vomited in his drunken sleep. Then verily I
thrust in the stake under the deep ashes until it
should grow hot, and heartened all my comrades
with cheering words, that I might see no man flinch
through fear. But when presently that stake of
olive-wood was about to catch fire, green though it
was, and began to glow terribly, then verily I drew
nigh, bringing the stake from the fire, and my com-
rades stood round me and a god breathed into us

great courage. They took the stake of olive-wood,
sharp at the point, and thrust it into his eye, while
I, throwing my weight upon it from above, whirled
it round, as when a man bores a ship's timber with
a drill, while those below keep it spinning with the
thong, which they lay hold of by either end, and the
drill runs ai-ound unceasingly. Even so we took the
fiery-pointed stake and whirled it around in his eye,
and the blood flowed around the heated thing. And
his eyelids wholly and his brows round about did
the flame singe as the eyeball burned, and its roots
crackled in the fire. And as when a smith dips a
great axe or an adze in cold water amid loud hissing
to temper it — for therefrom comes the strength of
iron — even so did his eye hiss round the stake of
olive-wood. Terribly then did he cry aloud, and the
rock rang ai*ound ; and we, seized with terror, shrank
back, while he wrenched from his eye the stake, all
befouled with blood, and flung it from him, wildly
waving his arms. Then he called aloud to the Cy-
clopes, who dwelt round about him in caves among
the windy heights, and they heard his cry and came
thronging from every side, and standing around the
cave asked him what ailed him :

" ' What so sore distress is thine, Polyphemus, that
thou criest out thus through the immortal night, and
makest us sleepless ? Can it be that some mortal
man is driving off thy flocks against thy will, or
slaying thee thyself by guile or by might?'

"Then from out the cave the mighty Polyphemus
answered them : ' My friends, it is Noraan that is
slaying me by guile and not by force.'

" And they made answer and addressed him with
winged words : ' If, then, no man does violence to

thee in thy loneliness, sickness which comes from
great Zeus thou mayest in no wise escape. Nay, do
thou pray to our father, the lord Poseidon.'

" So they spoke and went their way ; and my heart
laughed within me that my name and cunning device
had so beguiled. But the Cyclops, groaning and
travailing in anguish, groped with his hands and
took away the stone from the door, and himself sat
in the doorway with arms outstretched in the hope
of catching anyone who sought to go forth with the
sheep — so witless, forsooth, he thought in his heart
to find me. But I took counsel how all might be the
very best, if I might haply find some way of escape
from death for my comrades and for myself. And
I wove all manner of wiles and counsel, as a man
will in a matter of life and death ; for great was the
evil that was nigh us. And this seemed to my mind
the best plan. Rams there were, well-fed and thick
of fleece, fine beasts and large, with wool dark as
the violet. These I silently bound together with
twisted withes on which the Cyclops, that monster
with his heart set on lawlessness, was wont to sleep.
Three at a time I took. The one in the middle in
each case bore a man, and the other two went, one
on either side, saving my comrades. Thus every
three sheep bore a man. But as for me — there was
a ram, far the best of all the flock ; him I grasped
by the back, and curled beneath his shaggy belly,
lay there face upwards with steadfast heart, clinging
fast with, my hands to his wondrous fleece. So then,
with wailing, we waited for the bright dawn.

"As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,
then the males of the flock hastened forth to pasture
and the females bleated unmilked about the pens,

for their udders were bursting. And their master,
distressed with grievous pains, felt along the backs
of all the sheep as they stood up before him, but in
his folly he marked not this, that my men were
bound beneath the breasts of his fleecy sheep. Last
of all the flock the ram went forth, burdened with
the weight of his fleece and my cunning self. And
mighty Polyphemus, as he felt along his back, spoke
to him, saying :

" ' Good ram, why pray is it that thou goest forth
thus through the cave the last of the flock ? Thou
hast not heretofore been wont to lag behind the
sheep, but wast ever far the first to feed on the
tender bloom of the grass, moving with long strides,
and ever the first didst reach the streams of the
river, and the first didst long to return to the fold
at evening. But now thou art last of all. Surely
thou art sorrowing for the eye of thy master, which
an evil man blinded along with his miserable fellows,
when he had overpowered my wits with wine, even
Noman, who, I tell thee, has not yet escaped de-
struction. If only thou couldst feel as I do, and
couldst get thee power of speech to tell me where
he skulks away from my wrath, then should his
brains be dashed on the ground here and there
throughout the cave, when I had smitten him, and
my heart should be lightened of the woes which
good-for-naught Noman has brought me.'

"So saying, he sent the ram forth from him. And
when we had gone a little way from the cave and
the court, I first loosed myself from under the ram
and set my comrades free. Speedily then we drove
off those long-shanked sheep, rich with fat, turning
full often to look about until we came to the ship.

THE ODYSSEY, IX. 466-491

And welcome to our dear comrades was the si<rht of
us who had escaped death, but for the others they
wept and wailed ; yet I would not suffer them to
weep, but with a frown forbade each man. Rather
I bade them to Ming on board with speed the many
sheep of goodly fleece, and sail over the salt water.
So they went on board straightway and sat down
upon the benches, and sitting well in order smote
the grey sea with their oars. But when I was as far
away as a man's voice carries when he shouts, then
I spoke to the Cyclops with mocking words :

" ' Cyclops, that man, it seems, was no weakling,
whose comrades thou wast minded to devour by
brutal strength in thy hollow cave. Full surely were
thy evil deeds to fall on thine own head, thou cruel
wretch, who didst not shrink from eating thy guests
in thine own house. Therefore has Zeus taken
vengeance on thee, and the other gods.'

" So I spoke, and he waxed the more wroth at
heart, and broke off the peak of a high mountain
and hurled it at us, and cast it in front of the dark-
prowed ship. 1 And the sea surged beneath the
stone as it fell, and the backward flow, like a flood
from the deep, bore the ship swiftly landwards and
drove it upon the shore. But I seized a long pole in
my hands and shoved the ship off and along the
shore, and with a nod of my head I roused my com-
rades, and bade them fall to their oars that we might
escape out of our evil plight. And they bent to their
oars and rowed. But when, as we fared over the sea,
we were twice as far distant, then was 1 fain to call

to the Cyclops, though round about me my comrades,
one after another, sought to clack me with gentle
words :

"'Reckless one, why wilt thou provoke to wrath
a savage man, who but now hurled his missile into
the deep and drove our ship back to the land, and
verily we thought that we had perished there? And
had he heard one of us uttering a sound or speaking,
he would have hurled a jagged rock and crushed our
heads and the timbers of our ship, so mightily does
he throw.'

"So they spoke, but they could not persuade my
great-hearted spirit ; and I answered him again with
angry heart :

" ' Cyclops, if any one of mortal men shall ask
thee about the shameful blinding of thine eye, say
that Odysseus, the sacker of cities, blinded it, even
the son of Laertes, whose home is in Ithaca.'

" So I spoke, and he groaned and said in answer :
' Lo now, verily a prophecy uttered long ago is come
upon me. There lived here a soothsayer, a good
man and tall, Telemus, son of Eurymus, who ex-
celled all men in soothsaying, and grew old as a seer
among the Cyclopes. He told me that all these
things should be brought to pass in days to come,
that by the hands of Odysseus I should lose my sight.
But I ever looked for some tall and comely man to
come hither, clothed in great might, but now one
that is puny, a man of naught and a weakling, has
blinded me of my eye when he had overpowered me
with wine. Yet come hither, Odysseus, that I may
set before thee gifts of entertainment, and may speed
thy sending hence, that the glorious Earth-shaker may
grant it thee. For I am his son, and he declares him-

self my father ; and he himself will heal me, if it be
his good pleasure, but none other either of the blessed
gods or of mortal men.'

" So he spoke, and I answered him and said :
' Would that I were able to rob thee of soul and
life, and to send thee to the house of Hades, as
surely as not even the Earth-shaker shall heal thine
eye.'

"So I spoke, and he then prayed to the lord Po-
seidon, stretching out both his hands to the starry
heaven : ' Hear me, Poseidon, earth-enfolder, thou
dark-haired god, if indeed I am thy son and thou
declarest thyself my father; grant that Odysseus,
the sacker of cities, may never reach his home, even
the son of Laertes, whose home is in Ithaca ; but
if it is his fate to see his friends and to reach his
well-built house and his native land, late may he
come and in evil case, after losing all his comrades,
in a ship that is another's ; and may he find woes in
his house.'

"So he spoke in prayer, and the dark-haired god
heard him. But the Cyclops lifted on high again
a far greater stone, and swung and hurled it, putting
into the throw measureless strength. He cast it a
little behind the dark-prowed ship, and barely missed
the end of the steering-oar. And the sea surged
beneath the stone as it fell, and the wave bore the
ship onward and drove it to the shore.

" Now when we had come to the island, where our
other well-benched ships lay all together, and round
about them our comrades, ever expecting us, sat weep-
ing, then, on coming thither, we beached our ship on
the sands, and ourselves went forth upon the shore

of the sea. Then we took from out the hollow ship
the flocks of the Cyclops, and divided them, that so
far as in me lay no man might go defrauded of an
equal share. But the ram my well-greaved comrades
gave to me alone, when the flocks were divided, as a
gift apart; and on the shore 1 sacrificed him to Zeus,
son of Cronos, god of the dark clouds, who is lord of
all, and burned the thigh-pieces. Howbeit he heeded
not my sacrifice, but was planning how all my well-
benched ships might perish and my trusty comrades.

"So, then, all day long till set of sun we sat feast-
ing on abundant flesh and sweet wine ; but when the
sun set and darkness came on, then we lay down to
rest on the shore of the sea. And as soon as early
Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, I roused my com-
rades, and bade them themselves to embark and to
loose the stern cables. So they went on board
straightway and sat down upon the benches, and
sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their
oars.

"Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, glad to
have escaped death, though we had lost our dear
comrades.

"Then to the Aeolian isle we came, where dwelt
Aeolus, son of Hippotas, dear to the immortal gods,
in a Moating island, and all around it is a wall of
unbreakable bronze, and the cliff runs up sheer.
Twelve children of his, too, there are in the halls,
six daughters and six sturdy sons, and he gave his
daughters to his sons to wife. These, then, feast
continually by their dear father and good mother,
and before them lies boundless good cheer. And
the house, rilled with the savour of feasting, re-
sounds all about even in the outer court by day, 1
and by night again they sleep beside their chaste
wives on blankets and on corded bedsteads. To
their city, then, and fair palace did we come, and for
a full month he made me welcome and questioned
me about each thing, about Ilios, and the ships of
the Argives, and the return of the Achaeans. And
1 told him all the tale in due order. But when I, on
my part, asked him that I might depart and bade
him send me on my way, he, too, denied me nothing,
but furthered my sending. He gave me ajj^Btt,
made of the hide of an ox nine years old,' 2 wliCT^I^
flayed, and therein he bound the paths of the blus-
tering winds; for the son of Cronos had made him

merely to denote full maturity.

keeper of the winds, both to still and to rouse what-
ever one he will. And in my hollow ship he bound
it fast with a bright cord of silver, that not a breath
might escape, were it never so slight. But for my
furtherance he sent forth the breath of the West Wind
to blow, that it might bear on their way both ships
and men. Yet this he was not to bring to pass, for
we were lost through our own folly.

" For nine days we sailed, night and day alike, and
now on the tenth our native land came in sight, and
lo, we were so near that we saw men tending the
beacon fires. 1 Then upon me came sweet sleep in
my weariness, for I had ever kept in hand the sheet
of the ship, and had yielded it to none other of my
comrades, that we might the sooner come to our
native land. But my comrades meanwhile began to
speak one to another, and said that I was bringing
home for myself gold and silver as gifts from Aeolus,
the great-hearted son of Hippotas. And thus would
one speak, with a glance at his neighbour :

" ( Out on it, how beloved and honoured this man
is by all men, to whose city and land soever he
comes! Much goodly treasure is he carrying with
him from the land of Troy from out the spoil, while
we, who have accomplished the same journey as he,
are returning, bearing with us empty hands. And
now Aeolus has given him these gifts, granting them
freely of his love. Nay, come, let us quickly see
what is here, what store of gold and silver is in the
wallet.'

" So they spoke, and the evil counsel of my comrades
prevailed. They loosed the wallet, and all the winds
leapt forth, and swiftly the storm-wind seized them

and bore them weeping out to sea away from their
native land ; but as for me, I awoke, and pondered in
my goodly heart whether I should. Hing myself from
the ship and perish in tlie sea, or endure in silence
and still remain among the living. However, I en-
dured and abode, and covering my head lay down in
the ship. But the ships were borne by an evil blast
of wind back to the Aeolian isle ; and my comrades
groaned.

" There we went ashore and drew water, and
straightway my comrades took their meal by the
swift ships. But when we had tasted of food and
drink, I took with me a herald and one companion
and went to the glorious palace of Aeolus, and I
found him feasting beside his wife and his children.
So we entered the house and sat down by the door-
posts on the threshold, and they were amazed at
heart, and questioned us :

" ' How hast thou come hither, Odysseus ? What
cruel god assailed thee ? Surely we sent thee forth
with kindly care, that thou mightest reach thy
native land and thy home, and whatever place thou
wouldest.'

" So said they, but I with a sorrowing heart spoke
among them and said : ' Bane did my evil comrades
work me, and therewith sleep accursed ; but bring
ye healing, my friends, for with you is the power.'

" So I spoke and addressed thein with gentle words,
but they were silent. Then their father answered
and said :

" < Begone from our island with speed, thou vilest
of all that live. In no wise may I help or send upon
his way that man who is hated of the blessed gods.
Begone, for thou comest hither as one hated of the

immortals.'

"So saying, he sent me forth from the house,
groaning heavily. Thence we sailed on, grieved
at heart. And worn was the spirit of the men by
the grievous rowing, because of our own folly, for
no longer appeared any breeze to bear us on our
way. So for six days we sailed, night and day alike,
and on the seventh we came to the lofty citadel of
Lam us, even to Telepylus of the Laestrygonians,
where herdsman calls to herdsman as he drives in
his flock, and the other answers as he drives his
forth. There a man who never slept could have
earned a double wage, one by herding cattle, and
one by pasturing white sheep ; for the outgoings of
the night and of the day are close together. 1 When
we had come thither into the goodly harbour, about
which on both sides a sheer cliff" runs continuously,
and projecting headlands opposite to one another
stretch out at the mouth, and the entrance is
narrow, then all the rest steered their curved ships
in, and the ships were moored within the hollow
harbour close together ; for therein no wave ever
swelled, great or small, but all about was a bright
calm. But I alone moored my black ship outside, there
on the border of the land, making the cables fast to
the rock. Then I climbed to a rugged height, a
point of outlook, and there took my stand ; from
thence no works of oxen or of men appeared ;
smoke alone we saw springing up from the land.
So then I sent forth some of my comrades to go and
learn who the men were, who here ate bread upon

flock forth for the following day. Thus a man -who could
do without sleep could earn a double wage. The passage
is plainly due to some vague knowledge of the land of the



midnight aun.

the earth — two men I chose, and sent with them
a third as a herald. Now when they had gone
ashore, they went along a smooth road by which
waggons were wont to bring wood down to the city
from the high mountains. And before the city they
met a maiden drawing water, the goodly x daughter
of Laestrygonian Antiphates, who had come down to
the fair-flowing spring Artacia, from whence they
were wont to bear water to the town. So they came
up to her and spoke to her, and asked her who was
king of this folk, and who they were of whom he
was lord. And she showed tliem forthwith the
high-roofed house of her father. Now when they
had entered the glorious house, they found there his
wife, huge as the peak of a mountain, and they
were aghast at her. At once she called from the
place of assembly the glorious Antiphates, her hus-
band, and he devised for them woeful destruction.
Straightway he seized one of my comrades and made
ready his meal, but the other two sprang up and
came in flight to the ships. Then he raised a cry
throughout the city, and as they heard it the
mighty Laestrygonians came thronging from all
sides, a host past counting, not like men but like the
Giants. They hurled at us from the cliffs with
rocks huge as a man could lift, and at once there
rose throughout the ships a dreadful din, alike from
men that were dying and from ships that were
being crushed. And spearing them like fishes they
bore them home, a loathly meal. Now while they
were slaying those within the deep harbour, I mean-
it is used twice of Penelope, and more than once of other
women, in which cases no such connotation is to be thought
of, I have preferred to give a more general rendering.

while drew my sharp sword from beside my thigh,
and cut therewith the cables of my dark-prowed
ship ; and quickly calling to my comrades bade
them fall to their oars, that we might escape from
out our evil plight. And they all tossed the sea
with their oar-blades in fear of death, and joyfully
seaward, away from the beetling cliffs, my ship sped
on ; but all those other ships were lost together
there.

" Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, glad to
have escaped death, though we had lost our dear
comrades ; and we came to the isle of Aeaea, where
dwelt fair-tressed Circe, a dread goddess of human
speech," own sister to Aeetes of baneful mind; and
both are sprung from Melius, who gives light to
mortals, and from Perse, their mother, whom Oceanus
begot. Here we put in to shore with our ship in
silence, into a harbour where ships may lie, and
some god guided us. Then we disembarked, and
lay there for two days and two nights, eating our
hearts for weariness and sorrow. But when fair-
tressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day,
then 1 took my spear and my sharp sword, and
quickly went up from the ship to a place of wide
prospect, in the hope that I might see the works of
men, and hear their voice. So I climbed to a
rutrced height, a place of outlook, and there took
my stand, and I saw smoke rising from the broad-
wayed earth in the halls of Circe, through the thick
brush and the wood. And I debated in mind and
heart, whether I should go and make search, when
I had seen the flaming smoke. And as I pondered,
this seemed to me to be the better way, to go first

to the swift ship and the shore of the sea, and give
mv comrades their meal, and send them forth to
make search. 'But when, as I went, 1 was near to the
curved ship, then some god took pity on me in my
loneliness, and sent a great, high-horned stag into my
very path. He was coming down to the river from
his pasture in the wood to drink, for the might of
the sun oppressed him ; and as he came out I struck
him on the spine in the middle of the back, and the
bronze spear passed right through him, and down
he fell in the dust with a moan, and his spirit flew
from him. Then I planted my foot upon him, and
drew the bronze spear forth from the wound, and
left it there to lie on the ground. But for myself,
I plucked twigs and osiers, and weaving a rope as it
were a fathom in length, well twisted from end to
end, I bound together the feet of the monstrous
beast, and went my way to the black ship, bearing
him across my back and leaning on niy spear, since
in no wise could I hold him on my shoulder with one
hand, for he was a very mighty beast. Down I flung
him before the ship, and heartened my comrades
with gentle words, coming up to each man in turn :

" ' Friends, not yet shall we go down to the house
of Hades, despite our sorrows, before the day of
fate comes upon us. Nay, come, while there is
yet food and drink in our swift ship, let us bethink
us of food, that we pine not with hunger.'

"So I spoke, and they quickly hearkened to my
words. From their faces they drew their cloaks, 1
and marvelled at the stag on the shore of the
unresting sea, for he was a very mighty beast. But

1 The Greek veiled his face under stress of despairing
sorrow.

when they had satisfied their eyes with gazing, they
washed their hands, and made ready a glorious feast.
So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting
on abundant flesh and sweet wine. But when the
sun set and darkness came on, then we lay down
to rest on the shore of the sea. And as soon as
early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, I called my
men together, and spoke among them all :

"'Hearken to my words, comrades, for all your
evil plight. My friends, we know not where the
darkness is or where the dawn, neither where the
sun, who gives light to mortals, goes beneath
the earth, nor where he rises ; but let us straightway
take thought if any device be still left us. As for me
I think not that there is. For I climbed to a rugged
point of outlook, and beheld the island, about which
is set as a crown the boundless deep. The isle
itself lies low, and in the midst of it my eyes saw
smoke through the thick brush and the wood.'

" So I spoke, and their spirit was broken within
them, as they remembered the deeds of the Laes-
trygonian, Antiphates, and the violence of the
great-hearted Cyclops, the man-eater. And they
wailed aloud, and shed big tears. But no good
came of their mourning.

" Then I told off in two bands all my well-greaved
comrades, and appointed a leader for each band.
Of the one I took command, and of the other
godlike Eurylochus. Quickly then we shook lots
in a brazen helmet, and out leapt the lot of great-
hearted Eurylochus. So he set out, and with
him went two-and-twenty comrades, all weeping ;
and they left us behind, lamenting. Within the
forest glades they found the house of Circe, built

of polished stone in a place of wide outlook, 1 and
round about it were mountain wolves and lions,
whom Circe herself had bewitched ; for she gave
them evil drugs. Yet these beasts did not rush
upon my men, but pranced about them fawningly,
wagging their long tails. And as when hounds
fawn around their master as he comes from a
feast, for he ever brings them bits to soothe
their temper, so about them fawned the stout-
clawed wolves and lions ; but they were seized with
fear, as they saw the dread monsters. So they
stood in the gateway of the fair-tresscd goddess,
and within they heard Circe singing with sweet
voice, as she went to and fro before a great
imperishable web, such as is the handiwork of
goddesses, finely-woven and beautiful, and glorious.
Then among them spoke Polites, a leader of men,
dearest to me of my comrades, and trustiest :

" ( Friends, within someone goes to and fro, before
a great web, singing sweetly, so that all the floor
echoes ; some goddess it is, or some woman. Come,
let us quickly call to her.'

" So he spoke, and they cried aloud, and called
to her. And she straightway came forth and opened
the bright doors, and bade them in ; and all went
with her in their folly. Only Eurylochus remained
behind, for he suspected that there was a snare.
She brought them in and made them sit on chairs
and seats, and made for them a potion of cheese
and barley meal and yellow honey with Pramnian
wine ; but in the food she mixed baneful drugs, that
they might utterly forget their native land. Now

when she had given them the potion, and they
had drank it off, then she presently smote them
with her wand, and penned them in the sties.
And they had the heads, and voice, and bristles,
and shape of swine, but their minds remained
unchanged even as before. So they were penned
there weeping, and before them Circe flung mast
and acorns, and the fruit of the cornel tree, to
eat, such things as wallowing swine are wont to
feed upon.

" But Eurylochus came back straightway to the
swift, black ship, to bring tiding of his comrades
and their shameful doom. Not a word could he
utter, for all his desire, so stricken to the heart
was he with great distress, and his eyes were filled
with tears, and his spirit was set on lamentation.
But when we questioned him in amazement, then
he told the fate of the others, his comrades.

" < We went through the thickets, as thou badest,
noble Odysseus. We found in the forest glades a
fair palace, built of polished stones, in a place of
wide outlook. There someone was going to and
fro before a great web, and singing with clear voice,
some goddess or some woman, and they cried aloud,
and called to her. And she came forth straightway,
and opened the bright doors, and bade them in ;
and they all went with her in their folly. But I
remained behind, for I suspected that there was
a snare. Then they all vanished together, nor did
one of them appear again, though I sat long and
watched.'

" So he spoke, and I cast my silver-studded sword
about my shoulders, a great sword of bronze, and
slung my bow about me, and bade him lead me

hack by the self-same road. But he clasped me
with both hands, and besought me by my knees,
and with wailing he spoke to me winged words :

"'Lead me not thither against my will, O thou
fostered of Zeus, but leave me here. For I know
that thou wilt neither come back thyself, nor bring
anyone of thy comrades. Nay, with these that
are here let us flee with all speed, for still we
may haply escape the evil day.'

" So he spoke, but I answered him, and said :
1 Eurylochus, do thou stay here in this place, eating
and drinking by the hollow, black ship; but I will
go, for strong necessity is laid upon me.'

"So saying, I went up from the ship and the sea.
But when, as I went through the sacred glades,
I was about to come to the great house of the
sorceress, Circe, then Hermes, of the golden wand,
met me as I went toward the house, in the likeness
of a young man with the first down upon his lip,
in whom the charm of youth is fairest. He clasped
my hand, and spoke, and addressed me :

" ' Whither now again, hapless man, dost thou go
alone through the hills, knowing naught of the
country? Lo, thy comrades yonder in the house of
Circe are penned like swine in close-barred sties.
And art thou come to release them? Nay, I tell
thee, thou shalt not thyself return, but shalt remain
there with the others. But come, I will free thee
from harm, and save thee. Here, take this potent
herb, and go to the house of Circe, and it shall ward
oft" from thy head the evil day. And I will tell
thee all the baneful wiles of Circe. She will mix
thee a potion, and cast drugs into the food ; but

even so she shall not be able to bewitch thee, for
the potent herb that I shall give thee will not suffer
it. And I will tell thee all. When Circe shall
smite thee with her long wand, then do thou
draw thy sharp sword from beside thy thigh, and
rush upon Circe, as though thou wouldst slay her.
And she will be seized with fear, and will bid
thee lie with her. Then do not thou thereafter
refuse the couch of the goddess, that she may set
free thy comrades, and give entertainment to thee.
But bid her swear a great oath by the blessed gods,
that she will not plot against thee any fresh mis-
chief to thy hurt, lest when she has thee stripped
she may render thee a weakling and unmanned.'

" So saying, Argeiphontes gave me the herb, draw-
ing it from the ground, and showed me its nature.
At the root it was black, but its flower was like
milk. Moly the gods call it, and it is hard for
mortal men to dig ; but with the gods all things
are possible. Hermes then departed to high
Olympus through the wooded isle, and I went
my way to the house of Circe, and many things
did my heart darkly ponder as I went. So I
stood at the gates of the fair-tressed goddess.
There I stood and called, and the goddess heard
my voice. Straightway then she came forth, and
opened the bright doors, and bade me in ; and
I went with her, my heart sore troubled. She
brought me in and made me sit on a silver-studded
chair, a beautiful chair, richly wrought, and beneath
was a foot-stool for the feet. And she prepared me
a potion in a golden cup, that I might drink, and
put therein a drug, with evil purpose in her heart.

But when she had given it me, and I had drunk
it off, yet was not bewitched, she smote me with her
wand, and spoke, and addressed me : ' Begone now
to the sty, and lie with the rest of thy comrades.'

'•'So she spoke, but 1, drawing my sharp sword
from beside my thigh, rushed upon Circe, as
though I would slay her. But she, with a loud
cry, ran beneath, and clasped my knees, and
with wailing she spoke to me winged words:

"'Who art thou among men, and from whence?
Where is thy city, and where thy parents? Amaze-
ment holds me that thou hast drunk this charm
and wast in no wise bewitched. For no man
else soever hath withstood this charm, when once
he has drunk it, and it has passed the barrier
of his teeth. Nay, but the mind in thy breast
is one not to be beguiled. Surely thou art
Odysseus, the man of ready device, who Argei-
phontes of the golden wand ever said to me would
come hither on his way home from Troy with his
swift, black ship. Nay, come, put up thy sword in
its sheath, and let us two then go up into my bed,
that couched together in love we may put trust in
each other.'

" So she spoke, but I answered her, and said :

' Circe, how canst thou bid me be gentle to thee,

who hast turned my comrades into swine in thy

halls, and now keepest me here, and with guileful

purpose biddest me go to thy chamber, and go

up into thy bed, that when thou hast me stripped

thou mayest render me a weakling and unmanned?

Nay, verily, it is not I that shall be fain to go

up into thy bed, unless thou, goddess, wilt consent

to swear a mighty oath that thou wilt not plot

against me any fresh mischief to my hurt.'

" So I spoke, and she straightway swore the oath
to do me no harm, as I bade her. But when
she had sworn, and made an end of the oath,
then I went up to the beautiful bed of Circe.

" But her handmaids meanwhile were busied in the
halls, four maidens who are her serving-women in
the house. Children are they of the springs and
groves, and of the sacred rivers that flow forth
to the sea, and of them one threw upon chairs
fair rugs of purple above, and spread beneath
them a linen cloth ; another drew up before the
chairs tables of silver, and set upon them golden
baskets ; and the third mixed sweet, honey-hearted
wine in a bowl of silver, and served out golden
cups ; and the fourth brought water, and kindled
a great fire beneath a large cauldron, and the water
grew warm. But when the water boiled in the
bright bronze, she set me in a bath, and bathed
me with water from out the great cauldron, mixing
it to my liking, and pouring it over my head
and shoulders, till she took from my limbs soul-
consuming weariness. But when she had bathed
me, and anointed me richly with oil, and had
cast about me a fair cloak and a tunic, she brought
me into the hall, and made me sit upon a silver-
studded chair — a beautiful chair, richly wrought,
and beneath was a foot-stool for the feet. Then
a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair
pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin
for me to wash, and beside me drew up a polished
table. And the grave housewife brought and set
before me bread, and therewith meats in abundance,
granting freely of her store. Then she bade me eat,
but my heart inclined not thereto. Rather, I sat
with other thoughts, and my spirit boded ill.

" Now when Circe noted that I sat thus, and did
not put forth my hands to the food, but was
burdened with sore grief, she came close to me,
and spoke winged words :

"'Why, Odysseus, dost thou sit thus like one that
is dumb, eating thy heart, and dost not touch food
or drink? Dost thou haply forbode some other
guile ? Nay, thou needest in no wise fear, for
already have I sworn a mighty oath to do thee
no harm.'

" So she spoke, but I answered her, and said :
'Circe, what man that is right-minded could bring
himself to taste of food or drink, ere yet he had
won freedom for his comrades, and beheld them
before his face? But if thou of a ready heart
dost bid me eat and drink, set them free, that mine
eyes may behold my trusty comrades.'

"So I spoke, and Circe went forth through the hall
holding her wand in her hand, and opened the
doors of the sty, and drove them out in the
form of swine of nine years old. So they stood
there before her, and she went through the midst
of them, and anointed each man with another
charm. Then from their limbs the bristles fell
away which the baneful drug that queenly Circe
gave them had before made to grow, and they
became men again, younger than they were before,
and far comelier and taller to look upon. They
knew me, and clung to my hands, each man of
them, and upon them all came a passionate sobbing,
and the house about them rang wondrously, and the
goddess herself was moved to pity.

"Then the beautiful goddess drew near me, and
said : ' Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus

of many devices, go now to thy swift ship and to
the shore of the sea. First of all do ye draw the
ship up on the land, and store your goods and
all the tackling in caves. Then come back thyself,
and bring thy trusty comrades.'

" So she spoke, and my proud heart consented.
I went my way to the swift ship and the shore
of the sea, and there I found my trusty comrades
by the swift ship, wailing piteously, shedding big
tears. And as when calves in a farmstead sport
about the droves of cows returning to the yard,
when they have had their fill of grazing — all
together they frisk before them, and the pens no
longer hold them, but with constant lowing they
run about their mothers — so those men, when their
eyes beheld me, thronged about me weeping, and
it seemed to their hearts as though they had got
to their native land, and the very city of rugged
Ithaca, where they were bred and born. And with
wailing they spoke to me winged words :

" ' At thy return, O thou fostered of Zeus, we
are as glad as though we had returned to Ithaca, our
native land. But come, tell the fate of the others,
our comrades.'

" So they spoke, and I answered them with gentle
words : ' First of all let us draw the ship up on the
land, and store our goods and all the tackling in caves.
Then haste you, one and all, to go with me that you
may see your comrades in the sacred halls of Circe,
drinking and eating, for they have unfailing store.'

" So I spoke, and they quickly hearkened to my
words. Eurylochus alone sought to hold back all
my comrades, and he spoke, and addressed them
with winged words :

THE ODYSSEY, X. 431-459

" ' Ah, wretched men, whither are we going ?
Why are you so enamoured of these woes, as to
go down to the house of Ciree, who will change
us all to swine, or wolves, or lions, that so we
may guard her great house perforce ? Even so
did the Cyclops, when our comrades went to his
fold, and with them went this reckless Odysseus.
For it was through this man's folly that they too
perished.'

" So he spoke, and I pondered in heart, whether
to draw my long sword from beside my stout
thigh, and therewith strike off his head, and bring
it to the ground, near kinsman of mine by marriage
though he was ; but my comrades one after another
sought to check me with gentle words :

" ' O thou sprung from Zeus, as for this man, we
will leave him, if thou so biddest, to abide here
by the ship, and to guard the ship, but as for
us, do thou lead us to the sacred house of Circe.'

" So saying, they went up from the ship and the
sea. Nor was Eurylochus left beside the hollow ship,
but he went with us, for he feared my dread reproof.

" Meanwhile in her halls Circe bathed the rest
of my comrades with kindly care, and anointed
them richly with oil, and cast about them fleecy
cloaks and tunics ; and we found them all feasting
bountifully in the halls. But when they saw and
recognized one another, face to face, they wept
and wailed, and the house rang around. Then the
beautiful goddess drew near me, and said :

" ' No longer now do ye rouse this plenteous
lamenting. Of myself I know both all the woes
you have suffered on the teeming deep, and all
the wrong that cruel men have done you on the

land. Nay, come, eat food and drink wine, until
you once more get spirit in your breasts such as
when at the first you left your native land of rugged
Ithaca ; but now ye are withered and spiritless, ever
thinking of your weary wanderings, nor are your
hearts ever joyful, for verily ye have suffered
much.'

" So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented.
So there day after day for a full year we abode,
feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine. But
when a year was gone and the seasons turned, as
the months waned and the long days were brought
in their course, then my trusty comrades called me
forth, and said :

"'Strange man, bethink thee now at last of thy
native land, if it is fated for thee to be saved,
and to reach thy high-roofed house and thy native
land.'

" So they spoke, and my proud heart consented.
So then all dav lon£ till set of sun we sat feasting
on abundant flesh and sweet wine. But when
the sun set and darkness came on, they lay down
to sleep throughout the shadowy halls, but I went
up to the beautiful bed of Circe, and besought
her by her knees ; and the goddess heard my voice,
and I spoke, and addressed her with winged words :

" ' Circe, fulfil for me the promise which thou gavest
to send me home ; for my spirit is now eager to be
gone, and the spirit - of my comrades, who make
my heart to pine, as they sit about me mourning,
whensoever thou haply art not at hand.'

" So I spoke, and the beautiful goddess straightway
made answer: 'Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus,

in my house against your will ; but you must first
complete another journey, and come to the house
of Hades and dread Persephone, to seek soothsaying
of the spirit of Theban Teiresias, the blind seer,
whose mind abides steadfast. To him even in
death Persephone has granted reason, that he alone
should have understanding ; but the others flit about
as shadows.'

" So she spoke, and my spirit was broken within
me, and I wept as I sat on the bed, nor had my
heart any longer desire to live and behold the
light of the sun. But when I had had my fill of
weeping and writhing, then I made answer, and
addressed her, saying :

" ' O Circe, who will guide us on this journey ?
To Hades no man ever yet went in a black ship.'

" So I spoke, and the beautiful goddess straightway
made answer : ' Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus,
Odysseus of many devices, let there be in thy
mind no concern for a pilot to guide thy ship, 1
but set up thy mast, and spread the white sail,
and sit thee down ; and the breath of the North
Wind will bear her onward. But when in thy
ship thou hast now crossed the stream of Oceanus,
where is a level shore and the groves of Perse-
phone — tall poplars, and willows that shed their
fruit — there do thou beach thy ship by the deep
eddying Oceanus, but go thyself to the dank house
of Hades. There into Acheron flow Periphlegethon
and Cocytus, which is a branch of the water of
the Styx ; and there is a rock, and the meeting
place of the two roaring rivers. Thither, prince,
do thou draw nigh, as I bid thee, and dig a pit
of a cubit's length this way and that, and around
1 Or, "as thou tarriest by thy ship."

it pour a libation to all the dead, first with milk
and honey, thereafter with sweet wine, and in
the third place with water, and sprinkle thereon
white bailey meal. And do thou earnestly entreat
the powerless heads of the dead, vowing that when
thou comest to Ithaca thou wilt sacrifice in thy
halls a barren heifer, the best thou hast, and wilt
fill the altar with rich gifts ; and that to Teiresias
alone thou wilt sacrifice separately a ram, wholly
black, the goodliest of thy flock. But when with
prayers thou hast made supplication to the glorious
tribes of the dead, then sacrifice a ram and a
black ewe, turning their heads toward Erebus
but thyself turning backward, and setting thy face
towards the streams of the river. Then many
ghosts of men that are dead will come forth.
But do thou thereafter call to thy comrades, and
bid them flay and burn the sheep that lie there,
slain by the pitiless bronze, and make prayer to
the gods, to mighty Hades and to dread Perse-
phone. And do thou thyself draw thy sharp sword
from beside thy thigh, and sit there, not suffering
the powerless heads of the dead to draw near to
the blood, till thou hast enquired of Teiresias.
Then the seer will presently come to thee, leader
of men, and he will tell thee thy way and the
measures of thy path, and of thy return, how thou
mayest go over the teeming deep.'

"So she spoke, and straightway came golden-
throned Dawn. Round about me then she cast
a cloak and tunic as raiment, and the nymph
clothed herself in a long white robe, finely-woven
and beautiful, and about her waist she cast a fair
girdle of gold, and upon her head she put a veil,

But I went through the halls, and roused my men
with gentle words, coming up to each man in turn •

" ' No longer now sleep ye, and drowse in sweet
slumber, but let us go ; lo ! queenly Circe lias told
me all.'

" So I spoke, and their proud hearts consented.
But not even from thence could I lead my men
unscathed. There was one, Elpenor, the youngest
of all, not over valiant in war nor sound of
understanding, who had laid him down apart from
his comrades in the sacred house of Circe, seeking
the cool air, for he was heavy with wine. He
heard the noise and the bustle of his comrades
as they moved about, and suddenly sprang up,
and forgot to go to the long ladder that he might
come down again, but fell headlong from the roof,
and his neck was broken away from the spine, and
his spirit went down to the house of Hades.

" But as my men were going on their way I
spoke among them, saying : ' Ye think, forsooth,
that ye are going to your dear native land ; but
Circe has pointed out for us another journey, even
to the house of Hades and dread Persephone, to
consult the spirit of Theban Teiresias.'

" So I spoke, and their spirit was broken within
thopi, and sitting down right where they were,
they wept and tore their hair. But no good came
of their lamenting.

" But when we were on our way to the swift
ship and the shore of the sea, sorrowing and
shedding big tears, meanwhile Circe had gone
forth and made fast beside the black ship a ram
and a black ewe, for easily had she passed us by.
Who with his eyes could behold a god against his
will, whether going to or fro ?

BOOK XI

" But when we had come down to the ship and to
the sea, first of all we drew the ship down to the
bright sea, and set the mast and sail in the black
ship, and took the sheep and put them aboard, and
ourselves embarked, sorrowing, and shedding big
tears. And for our aid in the wake of our dark-
prowed ship a fair wind that filled the sail, a goodly
comrade, was sent by fair-tressed Circe, dread god-
dess of human speech. So when we had made fast
all the tackling throughout the ship, we sat down,
and the wind and the helmsman made straight her
course. All tne day long her sail was stretched as
she sped over the sea ; and the sun set and all the
ways grew dark.

" She came to deep-flowing Oceanus, that bounds
the Earth, 1 where is the land and city of the Cim-
merians, wrapped in mist and cloud. Never does
the bright sun look down on them with his rays
either when he mounts the starry heaven or when
he turns again to earth from heaven, but baneful
night is spread over wretched mortals. Thither we
came and beached our ship, and took out the sheep,
and ourselves went beside the stream of Oceanus
until we came to the place of which Circe had
told us.

" Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims,
while I drew my sharp sword from beside my thigh,

1 Or, possibly, " to Ocean's further marge."

THE ODYSSEY, XL 25-54

and dug a pit of a cubit's length this way and that,
and around it poured a libation to all the dead, first
with milk and honey, thereafter with sweet wine,
and in the third place with water, and I sprinkled
thereon white barley meal. And I earnestly entreated
the powerless heads of the dead, vowing that when
I came to Ithaca I would sacrifice in my halls a
barren heifer, the best I had, and pile the altar with —
goodly gifts, and to Teiresias alone would sacrifice —
separately a ram, wholly black, the goodliest of my
flocks. But when with vows and prayers I had made
supplication to the tribes of the dead, I took the
sheep and cut their throats over the pit, and the
dark blood ran forth. Then there gathered from
out of Erebus the spirits of those that are dead,
brides, and unwedded youths, and toil-worn old men,
and tender maidens with hearts yet new to sorrow,
and many, too, that had been wounded with bronze-
tipped spears, men slain in fight, wearing their blood-
stained armour. These came thronging in crowds
about the pit from every side, with a wondrous cry ;
and pale fear seized me. Then I called to my com-
rades and bade them flay and burn the sheep that _ .
lay there slain with the pitiless bronze, and to make
prayer to the gods, to mighty Hades and dread Per-
sephone. And I myself drew my sharp sword from
beside my thigh and sat there, and would not suffer
the powerless heads of the dead to draw near to the
blood until I had enquired of Teiresias.

"The first to come was the spirit of my comrade
Elpenor. Not yet had he been buried beneath the
broad-wayed earth, for we had left his corpse behind
us in the hall of Circe, unwept and unburied, since
another task was then urging us on. When I saw him

I wept, and my heart had compassion on him ; and I
spoke and addressed him with winged words:

" * Elpenor, how didst thou come beneatli the
murky darkness ? Thou coming on foot hast out-
stripped me in my black ship.'

" So I spoke, and with a groan he answered me and
said : ' Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus
of many devices, an evil doom of some god was my
undoing, and measureless wine. When I had lain"
down to sleep in the house of Circe I did not think to
go to the long ladder that I might come down again,
but fell headlong from the roof, and my neck was
broken away from the spine and my spirit went down
to the house of Hades. Now I beseech thee by those
whom we left behind, who are not present with us,
by thy wife and thy father who reared thee when a
babe, and by Telemachus whom thou didst leave an
only son in thy halls ; for I know that as thou goest
hence from the house of Hades thou wilt touch at
the Aeaean isle with thy well-built ship. There,
then, O prince, I bid thee remember me. Leave me
not behind thee unwept and unburied as thou goest
thence, and turn not away from me, lest haply I bring
the wrath of the gods upon thee. Nay, burn me with
my armour, all that is mine, and heap up a mound
for me on the shore of the grey sea, in memory of an
unhappy man, that men yet to be may learn of me.
Fulfil this my prayer, and fix upon the mound my
oar wherewith I rowed in life when I was among; my
comrades.'

"So he spoke, and I made answer and said: 'All
this, unhappy man, will I perform and do.'

"Thus we two sat and held sad converse one with

the other, I on one side holding my sword over the
blood, while on the other side the phantom of my
comrade spoke at large.

" Then there came up the spirit of my dead
mother, Anticleia, the daughter of great-hearted
Autolycus, whom I had left alive when I departed
for sacred Ilios. At sight of her I wept, and my
heart had compassion on her, but even so I would
not suffer her to come near the blood, for all my
great sorrow, until I had enquired of Teiresias.

" Then there came up the spirit of the Theban
Teiresias, bearing his golden staff in his hand, and
he knew me and spoke to me : ' Son of Laertes,
sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, what
now, hapless man ? Why hast thou left the light of
the sun and come hither to behold the dead and a
region where is no joy? Nay, give place from the
pit and draw back thy sharp sword, that I may drink
of the blood and tell thee sooth.'

" So he spoke, and I gave place and thrust my
silver-studded sword into its sheath, and when he
had drunk the dark blood, then the blameless seer
spoke to me and said :

"'Thou askest of thy honey-sweet return, glorious
Odysseus, but this shall a god make grievous unto
thee ; for I think not that thou shalt elude the
Earth-shaker, seeing that he has laid up wrath in
his heart against thee, angered that thou didst blind
his dear son. Yet even so ye may reach home,
though in evil plight, if thou wilt curb thine own
spirit and that of thy comrades, as soon as thou shalt
bring thy well-built ship to the island Thrinacia,
escaping from the violet sea, and ye find grazing
there the kine and goodly flocks of Helios, who

oversees and overhears all things. If thou leavest
these unharmed and heedest thy homeward way,
verily ye may yet reach Ithaca, though in evil plight.
But if thou harmest them, then I foresee ruin for
thy ship and thy comrades, and even if thou shalt
thyself escape, late shalt thou come home and in
evil case, after losing all thy comrades, in a ship that
is another's, and thou shalt find woes in thy house-
proud men that devour thy livelihood, wooing thy
godlike wife, and offering wooers' gifts. Yet verily
on their violent deeds shalt thou take vengeance
when thou comest. But when thou hast slain the
wooers in thy halls, whether by guile or openly with
the sharp sword, then do thou go forth, taking a
shapely oar, until thou comest to men that know
naught of the sea and eat not of food mingled with
salt, aye, and they know naught of ships with purple
cheeks, or of shapely oars that are as wings unto^
ships. And I will tell thee a sign right manifest,
which will not escape thee. When another wayfarer,
on meeting thee, shall say that thou hast a winnowing-
fan on thy stout shoulder, then do thou fix in the
earth thy shapely oar and make goodly offerings to
lord Poseidon — a ram, and a bull, and a boar that
mates with sows — and depart for thy home and offer
sacred hecatombs to the immortal gods who hold
broad heaven, to each one in due order. And death
shall come to thee thyself far from the sea, 1 a death
so gentle, that shall lay thee low when thou art over-

gony, a "cyclic" poem, attributed to Eugammon of Cyrene,
in which Odysseus was killed by Telegonus, his son by Circe,
with a spear tipped with the bone of a sea-fish. This story
has no foundation in the <J<lyixey, and those who adopt the
rendering " from out the sea" assume that these lines are a
late interpolation.

sooth.'

" So he spoke, and I made answer and said : ' Teire-
sias, of all this, I ween, the gods themselves have
spun the thread. But come, tell me this, and declare
it truly. I see here the spirit of my dead mother;
she sits in silence near the blood, and d?igns not to
look upon the face of her own son or to speak to
him. Tell me, prince, how she may recognize that
I am he ? '

"So I spoke, and he straightway made answer,
and, .said : 'Easy is the word t]iat I shall say and
put in thy mind. Whomsoever of those that are
dead and gone thou shalt suffer to "draw near the
blood, he will tell thee sooth ; but whomsoever thou
refusest, he surely will go back again.'

" So saying the spirit of the prince, Teiresias,
went back into the house of Hades, when he had
declared his prophecies ; but I remained there stead-
fastly until my mother came up and drank the dark
blood. At once then she knew me, and with wailing:
she spoke to me winged words :

" ' My child, how didst thou come beneath the
murky darkness, being still alive ? Hard is it for
those that live to behold these realms, for between
are great rivers and dread streams ; Oceanus first,
which one may in no wise cross on foot, but only
if one have a well-built ship. Art thou but now
come hither from Troy after long wanderings with
thy ship and thy companions? and hast thou not
yet reached Ithaca, nor seen thy wife in thy
halls ? '

1 That is, "in the midst of wealth and comfort."

" So she spoke, and I made answer and said : ' My
mother, necessity brought me down to the house of
Hades, to seek soothsaying of the spirit of Theban
Teiresias. For not yet have I come near to the
shore of Achaea, nor have I as yet set foot on my
own land, but have ever been w r andering, laden with
woe, from the day when first I went with goodly
Agamemnon to Ilios, famed for its horses, to fight
with the Trojans. But come, tell me this, and
declare it truly. What fate of grievous death over-
came thee ? Was it long disease, or did the archer,
Artemis, assail thee with her gentle shafts, and slay
thee ? And tell- me of my father and my son, whom
I ;/t:Jbehind m> . Does the honour that was mine
still abide with them, r,r * :z soin£ other man now

return? And tell me of 'my wedded wife, of her
purpose and of her mind. Does she abide with her
son, and keep all things safe f or has one already
wedded her, whosoever is best of the Achaeans ? '

" So I spoke, and my honoured mother straight-
way answered : ' Aye verily she abides with steadfast
heart in thy halls, and ever sorrowfully for her do the
nights and the days wane, as she weeps. But the fair
honour that was thine no man yet possesses, but Tele-
machus holds thy demesne unharassed, and feasts at
equal banquets, such as it is fitting that one who deals
judgment should share, for all men invite him. But
thy father abides there in the tilled land, and comes
not to the city, nor has he, for bedding, bed and
cloaks and bright coverlets, but through the winter
he sleeps in the house, where the slaves sleep, in the
ashes by the fire, and wears upon his body mean

me, that I may lament and groan the more ? '

" So I spoke, and my honoured mother straight-

the strong might of blazing fire destroys these, as
soon as the life leaves the white bones, and the spirit,
like a dream, flits away, and hovers to and fro. But
haste thee to the light with what speed thou mayest,
and bear all these things in mind, that thou mayest
hereafter tell them to thy wife.'

" Thus we two talked with one another ; and the
women came, for august Persephone sent them
forth, even all those that had been the wives and
the daughters of chieftains. These flocked in throngs
about the dark blood, and I considered how 1 might
question each ; and this seemed to my mind the
best counsel. I drew my long sword from beside,
my stout thigh, and would not suffer them to drink
of the dark blood all at one time. So they drew
near, one after the other, and each declared her
birth, and I questioned them all.

" Then verily the first that I saw was high-born
Tyro, who said that she was the daughter of noble
Salmoneus, and declared herself to be the wife of
Cretheus, son of Aeolus. She became enamoured of
the river, divine Enipeus, who is far the fairest
of rivers that send forth their streams upon the
earth, and she was wont to resort to the fair waters
of Enipeus. But the Enfolder and Shaker of the
earth took his form, and lay with her at the mouths
of the eddying river. And the dark wave stood
about them like a mountain, vaulted-over, and hid
the god and the mortal woman. And he loosed her
maiden girdle, and shed sleep upon her. But when
the god had ended his work of love, he clasped her
hand, and spoke, and addressed her :

" c Be glad, woman, in our love, and as the year
goes on its course thou shalt bear glorious children,

for not weak are the embraces of a god. These do
thou tend and rear. But now go to thy house, and
hold thy peace, and tell no man ; but know that
I am Poseidon, the shaker of the earth.'

" So saying, he plunged beneath the surging sea.
But she conceived and bore Pelias and Neleus, who
both became strong servants of great Zeus ; and
Pelias dwelt in spacious loleus, and was rich in
flocks, and the other dwelt in sandy Pylos. But her
other children she, the queenly among women, bore
to Cretheus, even Aeson, and Pheres, and Amythaon,
who fought from chariots. 1

"And after her 1 saw Antiope, daughter of Asopus,
who boasted that she had slept even in the arms of
Zeus, and she bore two sons, Amphion and Zethus,
who first established the seat of seven-gated Thebe.
and fenced it in with walls, for they could not dwell
in spacious Thebe unfenced, how mighty soever they
were.

" And after her I saw Alcmene, wife of Amphi-
tryon, who lay in the arms of great Zeus, and bore
Heracles, staunch in fight, the lion-hearted. And
Megara I saw, daughter of Creon, high of heart,
whom the son of Amphitryon, ever stubborn in
might, had to wife.

" And I saw the mother of Oedipodes, fair Epi-
caste, who wrought a monstrous deed in ignorance
of mind, in that she wedded her own son, and
he, when he had slain his own father, wedded
her, and straightway the gods made these things
known among men. Howbeit he abode as lord
of the Cadmeans in lovely Thebe, suffering woes
through the baneful counsels of the gods, but she

went down to the house of Hades, the strong
warder. She made fast a noose on high from a lofty
beam, overpowered by her sorrow, but for him she
left behind woes full many, even all that the Avengers
of a mother bring to pass.

"And I saw beauteous Chloris, whom once Neleus
wedded because of her beauty, when he had brought
countless gifts of wooing. Youngest daughter was
she of Amphion, son of Iasus, who once ruled
mightily in Orchomenus of the Minyae. And she
was queen of Pylos, and bore to her husband
glorious children, Nestor, and Chromius, and lordly
Periclymenus, and besides these she bore noble
Pero, a wonder to men. Her all that dwelt about
sought in marriage, but Neleus would give her to no
man, save to him who should drive from Phylace
the kine of mighty IphicleSj sleek and broad of
brow ; and hard they were to drive. These the
blameless seer alone undertook to drive off; but a
grievous fate of the gods ensnared him, even hard
bonds and the herdsmen of the field Howbeit
when at length the months and the days were being
brought to fulfilment, as the year rolled round, and
the seasons came on, then verily mighty Iphicles re-
leased him, when he had told all the oracles ; and
the will of Zeus was fulfilled.

" And I saw Lede, the wife of Tyndareus, who
bore to Tyndareus two sons, stout of heart, Castor
the tamer of horses, and the boxer Polydeuces.
These two the earth, the giver of life, covers> albeit
alive, and even in the world below they have honour
from Zeus. One day they live in turn, and one day
they are dead ; and they have won honour like unto
that of the gods.

"And after her I saw Iphimedeia, wife of Aloeus,
who declared that she had lain with Poseidon. She
bore two sons, but short of life were they, godlike
Otus, and far-famed Ephialtes — men whom the
earth, the giver of grain, reared as the tallest, and
far the comeliest, after the famous Orion. For at
nine years they were nine cubits in breadth and
in height nine fathoms. Yea, and they threatened
to raise the din of furious war against the immortals
in Olympus. They were fain to pile Ossa on
Olympus, and Pelion, with its waving forests, on
Ossa, that so heaven might be scaled. And this
they would have accomplished, if they had reached
the measure of manhood ; but the son of Zeus, whom
fair-haired Leto bore, slew them both before the
down blossomed beneath their temples and covered
their chins with a full growth of beard.

" And Phaedra and Procris I saw, and fair Ariadne,
the daughter of Minos of baneful mind, whom once
Theseus was fain to bear from Crete to the hill of
sacred Athens ; but he had no joy of her, for ere
that Artemis slew her in sea-girt Dia because of the
witness of Dionysus.

" And Maera and Clymene I saw> and hateful
Eriphyle, who took precious gold as the price of the
life of her own lord. But I cannot tell or name all
the wives and daughters of heroes that I saw ; ere
that immortal night would wane. Nay, it is now
time to sleep, either when I have gone to the swift
ship and the crew, or here. My sending shall rest
with the gods, and with you."

~~So he spoke, and they were all hushed in silence,
and were held spell-bound throughout the shadowy
■J halls. Then among them white-armed Arete was
the first to speak :

" Pliaeacians, how seems this man to you for come-
liness and stature, and for the balanced spirit within
him ? And moreover he is my guest, though each
of you has a share in this honour. Wherefore be
not in haste to send him away, nor stint your gifts
to one in such need ; for many are the treasures
which lie stored in your halls by the favour of the
gods."

Then among them spoke also the old lord Eche-
neus, who was an elder among the Pliaeacians :
" Friends, verily not wide of the mark or of our
own thought are the words of our wise queen. Nay,
do you give heed to them. Yet it is on Alcinous
here that deed and word depend."

Then again Alcinous answered him and said :
" This word of hers shall verily hold, as surely as I
live and am lord over the Pliaeacians, lovers of the
oar. But let our guest, for all his great longing
to return, nevertheless endure to remain until to-
morrow, till I shall make all our gift complete.
His sending shall rest with the men, with all, but
most of all with me ; for mine is the control in the
land."

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and
said : " Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men, if
you should bid me abide here even for a year, and
should further my sending, and give glorious gifts,
even that would I choose ; and it would be better
far to come with a fuller hand to my dear native
land. Aye, and I should win more respect and
love from all men who should see me when I had
returned to Ithaca."

Then again Alcinous made answer and said :
" Odysseus, in no wise as we look on thee do we

grace of words, and within thee is a heart of wisdom,
and thy tale thou hast told with skill, as doth a min-
strel, even the grievous woes of all the Argives and
of thine own self. But come, tell me this, and
declare it truly, whether thou sawest any of thy
godlike comrades, who went to Ilios together with
thee, and there met their fate. The night is before
us, long, aye, wondrous long, and it is not yet the
time for sleep in the hall. Tell on, I pray thee, the
tale of these wondrous deeds. Verily I could abide
until bright dawn, so thou wouldest be willing to
tell in the hall of these woes of thine."

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and
said : " Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men,
there is a time for many words and there is a time
also for sleep. But if thou art fain still to listen,
I would not begrudge to tell thee of other things
more pitiful still than these, even the woes of my
comrades, who perished afterward, who escaped
from the dread battle-cry of the Trojans, but
perished on their return through the will of an evil
woman.

" When then holy Persephone had scattered this
way and that the spirits of the women, there came
up the spirit of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, sorrow-
ing ; and round about him others were gathered,
spirits of all those who were slain with him in the
house of Aegisthus, and met their fate. He knew
me straightway, when he had drunk the dark blood,
and he wept aloud, and shed big tears, and stretched

forth his hands toward me eager to reach me. But
no longer had he aught of strength or might remain-
ing such as of old was in his supple limbs.

" When I saw him I wept, and my heart had
compassion on him, and I spoke, and addressed him
with winged words : ' Most glorious son of Atreus,
king of men, Agamemnon, what fate of grievous
death overcame thee? Did Poseidon smite thee
on board thy ships, when he had roused a furious
blast of cruel winds? Or did foemen work thee
harm on the land, while thou wast cutting off their
cattle and fair flocks of sheep, or wast fighting to
win their city and their women ? '

"So I spoke, and he straightway made answer
and said : ' Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus,
Odysseus of many devices, neither did Poseidon
smite me on board my ships, when he had roused
a furious blast of cruel winds, nor did foemen work
me harm on the land, but Aegisthus wrought for
me death and fate, and slew me with the aid of
my accursed wife, when he had bidden me to his
house and made me a feast, even as one slays an
ox at the stall. So I died by a most pitiful death,
and round about me the rest of my comrades were
slain unceasingly like white-tusked swine, which
are slaughtered in the house of a rich man of great
might at a marriage feast, or a joint meal, or a
rich drinking-bout. Ere now thou hast been present
at the slaying of many men, killed in single combat
or in the press of the fight, but in heart thou wouldst
have felt most pity hadst thou seen that sight,
how about the mixing bowl and the laden tables
we lay in the hall, and the floor all swam with
blood. But the most piteous cry that I heard was

that of the daughter of Priam, Cassandra, whom
guileful Clytemnestra slew by my side. 1 And I
sought to raise my hands and smite down the
murderess, dying though I was, pierced through
with the sword. But she, the shameless one,
turned her back upon me, and even though I
was going to the house of Hades deigned neither
to draw down my eyelids with her fingers nor to
close my mouth. So true is it that there is nothing
more dread or more shameless than a woman who
puts into her heart such deeds, even as she too
devised a monstrous thing, contriving death for
her wedded husband. Verily I thought that I
should come home welcome to my children and to
my slaves ; but she, with her heart set on utter
wickedness, has shed shame on herself and on
women yet to be, even upon her that doeth up-
rightly.'

" So he spoke, and I made answer and said : ' Ah,
verily has Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, visited
wondrous hatred on the race of Atreus from the first
because of the counsels of women. For Helen's sake
many of us perished, and against thee Clytemnestra
spread a snare whilst thou wast afar.'

" So I spoke, and he straightway made answer and
said : ' Wherefore in thine own case be thou never
gentle even to thy wife. Declare not to her all the
thoughts of thy heart, but tell her somewhat, and let
somewhat also be hidden. Yet not upon thee, Odys-
seus, shall death come from thy wife, for very prudent
and of an understanding heart is the daughter of

Icarius, wise Penelope. Verily we left her a bride
newly wed, when we went to the war, and a hoy was
at her breast, a babe, who now, I ween, sits in the
ranks of men, happy in that his dear father will be-
hold him when he comes, and he will greet his father
as is meet. But my wife did not let me sate my eyes
even with sight of my own son. Nay, ere that she slew
even me, her husband. And another thing will I tell
thee, and do thou lay it to heart : in secret and not
openly do thou bring thy ship to the shore of thy dear
native land ; for no longer is there faith in women.
But. come, tell me this, and declare it truly, whether
haply ve hear of my son as yet alive in Orchomenus
it may be, or in sandv Pylos, or yet with Menelaus in
wide Sparta ; for not yet has goodly Orestes perished
on the earth.'

"So he spoke, and I made answer and said : ' Son
of Atreus, wherefore dost thou question me of this.'
I know not at all whether he be alive or dead, and it
is an ill thing to speak words vain as wind.'

"Thus we two stood and held sad converse with
one another, sorrowing and shedding big tears; and
there came up the spirit of Achilles, son of Peleus,
and those of Patroclus and of peerless Antilochi.s and
of Aias, who in comeliness and form was the goodliest
of all the Danaans after the peerless son of Peleus.
And the spirit of the swift-footed son of Aeacus
recognized me, and weeping, spoke to me winged
words :

" Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of
many devices, rash man. what deed yet greater than
this wilt thou devise in thy heart? How didst thou
dare to come down to Hades, where dwell the un-
heeding dead, the phantoms of men outworn.' 1

1 Or, perhaps, " who havo done with (life's) toils."

"'So he spoke, and I made answer and said:
Achilles, son of Peleus, far the mightiest of the
Achaeans, I came through need of Teiresias, 1 if haply
he would tell me some plan whereby I might reach
rugged Ithaca. For not yet have I come near to
the land of Achaea, nor have I as yet set foot on my
own country, but am ever suffering woes ; whereas
than thou, Achilles, no man aforetime was more
blessed nor shall ever be hereafter. For of old, when
thou wast alive, we Argives honoured thee even as
the gods, and now that thou art here, thou rulest
mightily among the dead. Wherefore grieve not at
all that thou art dead, Achilles.'

" So I spoke, and he straightway made answer and
said : ' Nay, seek not to speak soothingly to me of
death, glorious Odysseus. I should choose, so I
might live on earth, 2 to serve as the hireling of
another, of some portionless man whose livelihood
was but small, rather than to be lord over all the
dead that have perished. But come, tell me tidings
of my son, that lordly youth, whether or not he
followed to the war to be a leader. And tell
me of noble Peleus, if thou hast heard aught,
whether he still has honour among the host of
the Myrmidons, or whether men do him dishonour
throughout Hellas and Phthia, because old age binds
him hand and foot. For I am not there to bear him
aid beneath the rays of the sun in such strength as
once was mine in wide Troy, when I slew the best
of the host in defence of the Argives. If but in such
strength 1 could come, were it but for an hour, to
my father's house, I would give many a one of those
who do him violence and keep him from his honour,
cause to rue my strength and my invincible hands.'

"So he spoke, and I made answer and said:
'Verily of noble Peleus have I heard naught, but as
touching thy dear son, Neoptolemus, I will tell thee
all the truth, as thou biddest me. I it was, myself,
who brought him from Scyros in my shapely, hollow
ship to join the host of the well-greaved Achaeans.
And verily, as often as we took counsel around the
city of Troy, he was ever the first to speak, and made
no miss of words ; godlike Nestor and I alone sur-
passed him. But as often as we fought with the
bronze on the Trojan plain, he would never remain
behind in the throng or press of men, but would ever
run forth far to the front, yielding to none in his
might ; and many men he slew in dread combat. All
of them I could not tell or name, all the host that he
slew in defence of the Argives ; but what a warrior
was that son of Telephus whom he slew with the
sword, the prince Eurypylus ! Aye, and many of his
comrades, the Ceteians, were slain about him, because
of gifts a woman craved. 1 He verily was the come-
liest man I saw, next to goodly Memnon. And again,
when we, the best of the Argives, were about to go
down into the horse which Epeus made, and the
command of all was laid upon me, both to open and
to close the door of our stout-built ambush, then the
other leaders and counsellors of the Danaans would
wipe away tears from their eyes, and each man's
limbs shook beneath him, but never did my eyes see
his fair face grow pale at all, nor see him wiping tears
from his cheeks ; but he earnestly besought me to
let him go forth from the horse, and kept handling
his sword-hilt and his spear heavy with bronze, and

1 The reference is to the golden vine, given hj Priam to
Astyoche, wife of Telephus, which gift led her to send her
son Eurypylus to the aid of the Trojans.

was eager to work harm to the Trojans. But after
we had sacked the lofty city of Priam, he went
on board his ship with his share of the spoil and
a goodly prize — all unscathed he was, neither
smitten with the sharp spear nor wounded in close
fight, as often befalls in war ; for Ares rages con-
fusedly.'

"So I spoke, and the spirit of the son of
Aeacus departed with long strides over the field of
asphodel, joyful in that I said that his son was pre-
eminent.

" And other spirits of those dead and gone stood
sorrowing, and each asked of those dear to him.
Alone of them all the spirit of Aias, son of Telamon,
stood apart, still full of wrath for the victory that I
had won over him in the contest by the ships for the
arms of Achilles, whose honoured mother had set
them for a prize ; and the judges were the sons of
the Trojans and Pallas Athene. I would that I had
never won in the contest for such a prize, over so
noble a head did the earth close because of those
arms, even over Aias, who in comeliness and in deeds
of war was above all the other Danaans, next to the
peerless son of Peleus. To him I spoke with soothing
words :

" 'Aias, son of peerless Telamon, wast thou then
not even in death to forget thy wrath against me
because of those accursed arms ? Surely the gods
set them to be a bane to the Argives : such a tower
of strength was lost to them in thee ; and for thee
in death we Achaeans sorrow unceasingly, even as
for the life of Achilles, son of Peleus. Yet no other
is to blame but Zeus, who bore terrible hatred
against the host of Danaan spearmen, and brought

on thee thy doom. Nay, come hither, prince, that
thou mayest hear my word and my speech ; and
subdue thy wrath and thy proud spirit.'

" So I spoke, but he answered me not a word, but
went his way to Erebus to join the other spirits
of those dead and gone. Then would he never-
theless have spoken to me for all his wrath, or
I to him, but the heart in my breast was fain to
see the spirits of those others that are dead.

" There then I saw Minos, the glorious son of
Zeus, golden sceptre in hand, giving judgment to
the dead from his seat, while they sat and stood
about the king through the wide-gated house of
Hades, and asked of him judgment.

"And after him I marked huge Orion driving
together over the field of asphodel wild beasts
which himself had slain on the lonely hills, .and
in his hands he held a club all of bronze, ever
unbroken.

" And I saw Tityos, son of glorious Gaea, lying
on the ground. Over nine roods x he stretched,
and two vultures sat, one on either side, and tore
his liver, plunging their beaks into his bowels,
nor could he beat them off with his hands. For
he had offered violence to Leto, the glorious wife
of Zeus, as she went toward Pytho through Panopeus
with its lovely lawns.

"Aye, and I saw Tantalus in violent torment,
standing in a pool, and the water came nigh unto
his chin. He seemed as one athirst, but could
not take and drink ; for as often as that old man
stooped down, eager to drink, so often would the
water be swallowed up and vanish away, and at

his feet the black earth would appear, for some
god made all dry. And trees, high and leafy, let
stream their fruits above his head, pears, and pome-
granates, and apple trees with their bright fruit,
and sweet figs, and luxuriant olives. Rut as often
as that old man would reach out toward these,
to clutch them with his hands, the wind would toss
them to the shadowy clouds.

" Aye, and I saw Sisyphus in violent torment,
seeking to raise a monstrous stone with both his
hands. Verily he would brace himself with hands
and feet, and thrust the stone toward the crest
of a hill, but as often as he was about to heave
it over the top, the weight would turn it back,
and then down again to the plain would come
rolling the ruthless stone. But he would strain
again and thrust it back, and the sweat flowed down
from his limbs, and dust rose up from his head.

" And after him I marked the mighty Heracles —
his phantom ; for he himself among the immortal
gods takes his joy in the feast, and has to wife
Hebe, of the fair ankles, daughter of great Zeus
and of Here, of the golden sandals. About him
rose a clamour from the dead, as of birds flying
everywhere in terror ; and he like dark night, with
his bow bare and with arrow on the string, glared
about him terribly, like one in act to shoot. Awful
was the belt about his breast, a baldric of gold,
whereon wondrous things were fashioned, bears and
wild boars, and lions with flashing eyes, and con-
flicts, and battles, and murders, and slayings of
men. May he never have designed, 1 or hereafter

design such another, even he who stored up in
his craft the device of that belt. He in turn knew
me when his eyes beheld me, and weeping spoke
to me winged words :

" ' Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus
of many devices, ah, wretched man, dost thou, too,
drag out an evil lot such as I once bore beneath
the rays of the sun ? I was the son of Zeus, son
of Cronos, but I had woe beyond measure ; for to
a man far worse than I was I made subject, and
he laid on me hard labours. Yea, he once sent
me hither to fetch the hound of Hades, for he
could devise for me no other task mightier than
this. The hound I carried off and led forth from
the house of Hades ; and Hermes was my guide, and
flashin<j-eved Athene.'

" So saying, he went his way again into the house
of Hades, but I abode there steadfastly, in the hope
that some other haply might still come forth of the
warrior heroes who died in the days of old. And
I should have seen yet others of the men of former
time, whom I was fain to behold, even Theseus
and Peirithous, glorious children of the gods, but
ere that the myriad tribes of the dead came
thronging up with a wondrous cry, and pale fear
seized me, lest august Persephone might send forth
upon me from out the house of Hades the head
of the Gorgon, that awful monster.

" Straightway then I went to the ship and bade
my comrades themselves to embark, and to loose
the stern cables. So they went on board quickly
and sat down upon the benches. And the ship
was borne down the stream Oceanus by the swell-
ing flood, first with our rowing, and afterwards the
wind was fair.

BOOK XII

" Now after our ship had left the stream of the
river Oceanus and had come to the wave of the
broad sea, and the Aeaean isle, where is the dwell-
ing of early Dawn and her dancing-lawns, and
the risings of the sun, there on our coming we
beached our ship on the sands, and ourselves went
forth upon the shore of the sea, and there we
fell asleep, and waited for the bright Dawn.

" As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-
fingered, then I sent forth my comrades to the
house of Circe to fetch the body of the dead
Elpenor. Straightway then we cut billets of wood
and gave him burial where the headland runs
furthest out to sea, sorrowing and shedding big
tears. But when the dead man was burned, and
the armour of the dead, we heaped up a mound
and dragged on to it a pillar, and on the top of
the mound we planted his shapely oar.

" We then were busied with these several tasks,
howbeit Circe was not unaware of our coming forth
from the house of Hades, but speedily she arrayed
herself and came, and her handmaids brought with
her bread and meat in abundance and flaming
red wine. And the beautiful goddess stood in our
midst, and spoke among us, saying :

" ' Rash men, who have gone down alive to the
house of Hades to meet death twice, while other

men die but once. Nay, come, eat food and drink
wine here this whole day through ; but at the
coming of Dawn ye shall set sail, and I will point
out the way and declare to you each thing, in
order that ye may not suffer pain and woes through
wretched ill-contriving either by sea or on land.'

" So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented.
So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting
on abundant flesh and sweet wine. But when
the sun set and darkness came on, they lay down
to rest beside the stern cables of the ship ; but Circe
took me by the hand, and leading me apart from
my dear comrades, made me to sit, and herself
lay down close at hand and asked me all the tale.
And I told her all in due order. Then queenly
Circe spoke to me and said :

"'All these things have thus found an end;
but do thou hearken as I shall tell thee, and a god
shall himself bring it to thy mind. To the Sirens
first shalt thou come, who beguile all men whoso-
ever comes to them. Whoso in ignorance draws
near to them and hears the Sirens' voice, he never-
more returns, that his wife and little children may
stand at his side rejoicing,, but the Sirens beguile
him with their clear-toned song, as they sit in a
meadow, and about them is a great heap of bones
of mouldering men, and round the bones the skin
is shrivelling. But do thou row past them, and
anoint the ears of thy comrades with sweet wax,
which thou hast kneaded, lest any of the rest
may hear. But if thou thyself hast a will to listen,
let them bind thee in the swift ship hand and
foot upright in the step of the mast, and let the
ropes be made fast at the ends to the mast itself,

that with delight thou mayest listen to the voice
of the two Sirens. And if thou shalt implore
and bid thy comrades to loose thee, then let them
bind thee with yet more bonds. But when thy
comrades shall have rowed past these, thereafter
I shall not fully say on which side thy course is
to lie, but do thou thyself ponder it in mind,
and I will tell thee of both ways. For on the
one hand are beetling crags, and against them
roars the great wave of dark-eyed Amphitrite ;
the Planctae 1 do the blessed gods call these.
Thereby not even winged things may pass, no,
not the timorous doves that bear ambrosia to father
Zeus, but the smooth rock ever snatches away one
even of these, and the father sends in another to
make up the tale. And thereby has no ship of
men ever yet escaped that has come thither, but
the planks of ships and bodies of men are whirled
confusedly by the waves of the sea and the blasts
of baneful fire. One seafaring ship alone has
passed thereby, that Argo famed of all, on her
voyage from Aeetes, and even her the wave would
speedily have dashed there against the great crags,
had not Here sent her through, for that Jason was
dear to her.

"'Now on the other path are two cliffs, one of
which reaches with its sharp peak to the broad
heaven, and a dark cloud surrounds it. This never
melts away, nor does clear sky ever surround that
peak in summer or in harvest time. No mortal
man could scale it or set foot upon the top, not
though he had twenty hands and feet ; for the
rock is smooth, as if it were polished. And in

THE ODYSSEY, XII. 80-108

the midst of the cliff is a dim cave, turned to the
West, toward Erebus, even where you shall steer
your hollow ship, glorious Odysseus. Not even a
man of might could shoot an arrow from the hollow
ship so as to reach into that vaulted cave. Therein
dwells Scylla, yelping terribly. Her voice is indeed
but as the voice of a new-born whelp, but she
herself is an evil monster, nor would anyone be
glad at sight of her, no, not though it were a
god that met her. Verily she has twelve feet,
all misshapen, 1 and six necks, exceeding long,
and on each one an awful head, and therein three
rows of teeth, thick and close, and full of black
death. Up to her middle she is hidden in the
hollow cave, but she holds her head out beyond
the dread chasm, and fishes there, eagerly searching
around the rock for dolphins and sea-dogs and
whatever greater beast she may haply catch, such
creatures as deep-moaning Amphitrite rears in mul-
titudes past counting. By her no sailors yet may
boast that they have fled unscathed in their ship,
for with each head she carries off a man, snatching
him from the dark-prowed ship.

" ' But the other cliff, thou wilt note, Odysseus,
is lower — they are close to each other ; thou couldst
even shoot an arrow across— and on it is a great
fig tree with rich foliage, but beneath this divine
Charybdis sucks down the black water. Thrice a
day she belches it forth, and thrice she sucks it
down terribly. Mayest thou not be there when
she sucks it down, for no one could save thee
from ruin, no, not the Earth-shaker. Nay, draw

1 The word is a doubtful one. Others render, " dangling
down."

very close to Scylla's cliff, and drive thy ship past
quickly ; for it is better far to mourn six comrades
in thy ship than all together.'

" So she spoke, but I made answer and said :
' Come, I pray thee, goddess, tell me this thing
trulv, if in any wise I might escape from fell
Cha.ybdis, and ward off that other, when she works
harm to my comrades.'

" So I spoke, and the beautiful goddess answered
and said : ' Rash man, lo, now again thy heart is
set on the deeds of war and on toil. Wilt thou
not yield even to the immortal gods ? She is not
mortal, but an immortal bane, dread, and dire,
and fierce, and not to be fought with ; there is no
defence ; to flee from her is bravest. For if thou
tarriest to arm thyself by the cliff, I fear lest she
may again dart forth and attack thee with as many
heads and seize as many men as before. Nay, row
past with all thy might, and call upon Crataiis, the
mother of Scylla, who bore her for a bane to mortals.
Then will she keep her from darting forth again.

"'And thou wilt come to the isle Thrinacia
There in great numbers feed the kine of Helios
and his goodly flocks, seven herds of kine and as
many fair flocks of sheep, and fifty in each. These
bear no young, nor do they ever die, and goddesses
are their shepherds, fair-tressed nymphs, Phaethusa
and Lampetie, whom beautiful Neaera bore to
Helios Hyperion. These their honoured mother,
when she had borne and reared them, sent to the
isle Thrinacia to dwell afar, and keep the flocks
of their father and his sleek kine. If thou leavest
these unharmed and heedest thy homeward way,
verily ye may yet reach Ithaca, though in evil

plight. But if thou harmest them, then I foretelJ
ruin for thy ship and for thy comrades, and even
if thou shalt thyself escape, late shalt thou come
home and in evil case, after losing all thy com-
rades.'

" So she spoke, and presently came golden-
throned Dawn. Then the beautiful goddess de-
parted up the island, but I went to the ship and
roused my comrades themselves to embark and to
loose the stern cables. So they went on board
straightway and sat down upon the benches, and
sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their
oars. And for our aid in the wake of our dark-
prowed ship a fair wind that filled the sail, a
goodly comrade, was sent by fair-tressed Circe,
dread goddess of hilman speech. So when we had
straightway made fast all the tackling throughout
the ship we sat down, but the wind and the helms-
man guided the ship.

"Then verily I spoke among my comrades,
grieved at heart : ' Friends, since it is not right
that one or two alone should know the oracles
that Circe, the beautiful goddess, told me, there-
fore will 1 tell them, in order that knowing them
we may either die or, shunning death and fate,
escape. First she bade us avoid the voice of the
wondrous Sirens, and their flowery meadow. Me
alone she bade to listen to their voice ; but do
ye bind me with grievous bonds, that I may abide
fast where I am, upright in the step of the mast,
and let the ropes be made fast at the ends to
the mast itself; and if I implore and bid you to
loose me, then do ye tie me fast with yet more
bonds.'

THE ODYSSEY, XII. 165-189

"Thus I rehearsed all these things and tqld them
to my comrades. Meanwhile the well-huilt ship
speedily came to the isle of the two Sirens, for
a fair and gentle wind bore her on. Then pre-
sently the wind ceased and there was a windless
calm, and a god lulled the waves to sleep. But
my comrades rose up and furled the sail and
stowed it in the hollow ship, and thereafter sat
at the oars and made the water white with their
polished oars of fir. But I with my sharp sword
cut into small bits a great round cake of wax,
and kneaded it with my strong hands, and soon
the wax grew warm, forced by the strong pressure
and the rays of the lord Helios Hyperion. 1 Then
I anointed with this the ears of all my comrades
in turn ; and they bound me in the ship hand
and foot, upright in the step of the mast, and made
the ropes fast at the ends to the mast itself;
and themselves sitting down smote the grey sea
with their oars. But when we were as far distant
as a man can make himself heard when he shouts,
driving swiftly on our way, the Sirens failed not
to note the swift ship as it drew near, and they
raised their clear-toned song :

" ' Come hither, as thou farest, renowned Odysseus,
great glory of the Achaeans ; stay thy ship that thou
mayest listen to the voice of us two. For never yet
has any man rowed past this isle in his black ship
until he has heard the sweet voice from our lips.
Nay, he has joy of it, and goes his way a wiser man.
For we know all the toils that in wide Troy the

Argives and Trojans endured through the will of the
gods, and we know all things that come to pass upon
the fruitful earth.'

"So they spoke, sending forth their beautiful
voice, and my heart was fain to listen, and I bade
my comrades loose me, nodding to them with my
brows ; but they fell to their oars and rowed on.
And presently Perimedes and Eurylochus arose and
bound me with yet more bonds and drew them
tighter. But when they had rowed past the Sirens,
and we could no more hear their voice or their song,
then straightway my trusty comrades took away the
wax with which I had anointed their ears and loosed
me from my bonds.

" But when we had left the island, I presently saw
smoke and a great billow, and heard a booming.
Then from the hands of my men in their terror the
oars flew, and splashed one and all in the swirl, and
the ship stood still where it Avas, when they no longer
plied with their hands the tapering oars. But I
went through the ship and cheered my men with
gentle words, coming up to each man in turn :

" ' Friends, hitherto we have been in no wise
ignorant of sorrow ; surely this evil that besets us
now is no greater than when the Cyclops penned
us in his hollow cave by brutal strength ; yet even
thence we made our escape through my valour
and counsel and wit ; these dangers, too, methinks
we shall some day remember. But now come, as I
bid, let us all obey. Do you keep your seats on the
benches and smite with your oars the deep surf of
the sea, in the hope that Zeus may grant us to
escape and avoid this death. And to thee, steers-
man, I give this command, and do thou lay it to

heart, since thou wieldest the steering oar of the
hollow ship. From this smoke and surf keep the
ship well away and hug the cliff, lest, ere thou know
it, the ship swerve off to the other side and thou
east us into destruction.'

" So I spoke, and they quickly hearkened to my
words. But of Scylla I went not on to speak, a
cureless bane, lest haply my comrades, seized with
fear, should cease from rowing and huddle together
in the hold. Then verily I forgot the hard com-
mand of Circe, whereas she bade me in no wise
to arm myself; but when I had put on my glorious
armour and grasped in my hand two long spears,
I went to the fore-deck of the ship, whence I
deemed that Scylla of the rock would first be seen,
who was to bring ruin upon my comrades. But
nowhere could I descry her, and my eyes grew
weary as I gazed everywhere toward the misty
rock.

"We then sailed on up the narrow strait with
wailing. For on one side lay Soy 11a and on the other
divine Charybdis terribly sucked down the salt water
of the sea. Verily whenever she belched it forth,
like a cauldron on a great fire she would seethe and
bubble in utter turmoil, and high over head the
spray would fall on the tops of both the cliffs. But
as often as she sucked down the salt water of the
sea, within she could all be seen in utter turmoil, and
round about the rock roared terribly, while beneath
the earth appeared black with sand ; and pale fear
seized my men. So we looked toward her and feared
destruction ; but meanwhile Scylla seized from out
the hollow ship six of my comrades who were the
best in strength and in might. Turning my eyes to

the swift ship and to the company of my men, 1 even
then I noted above me their feet and hands as they
were raised aloft. To me they cried aloud, calling
upon me by name for that last time in anguish of
heart. And as a fisher on a jutting rock, when he
casts in his baits as a snare to the little fishes, with
his long pole lets down into the sea the horn of an
ox of the steading, 2 and then as he catches a fish
flings it writhing ashore, even so were they drawn
writhing up towards the cliffs. Then at her doors
she devoured them shrieking and stretching out
their hands toward me in their awful death-struggle.
Most piteous did mine eyes behold that thing of all
that I bore while I explored the paths of the sea.

" Now when we had escaped the rocks, and dread
Charybdis and Scylla, presently then we came to the
goodly island of the god, where were the fair kine,
broad of brow, and the many goodly flocks of Helios
Hyperion. Then while I was still out at sea in my
black ship, I heard the lowing of the cattle that
were being stalled and the bleating of the sheep,
and upon my mind fell the words of the blind seer,
Theban Teiresias, and of Aeaean Circe, who very
straitly charged me to shun the island of Helios,
who gives joy to mortals. Then verily I spoke among
my comrades, grieved at heart :

" ' Hear my words, comrades, for all your evil
plight, that I may tell you the oracles of Teiresias
and of Aeaean Circe, who very straitly charged me
to shun the island of Helios, who gives joy to

a pole tipped with bone (it will be noticed that there is no
mention of a line) ; (2) that a bit of hollow, tube-liko bone
was slipped over the line just above the hook to prevent its
being bitten through ; and (3) that the bone was really an
artificial bait (see Haakins in Journ. Philol. xix. 238 ff.).

mortals ; for there, she said, was our most terrible
bane. Nay, row the black ship out past the island.'

"So I spoke, but their spirit was broken within
them, and straightway Euryloehus answered me with
hateful words :

" ' Hardy art thou, Odysseus ; thou hast strength
beyond that of other men and thy limbs never grow
weary. Verily thou art wholly wrought of iron,
seeing that thou sufferest not thy comrades, worn
out with toil and drowsiness, to set foot on shore,
where on this sea-girt isle we might once more make
ready a savoury supper ; but thou biddest us even as
we are to wander on through the swift night, driven
away from the island over the misty deep. It is
from the night that fierce winds are born, wreckers
of ships. How could one escape utter destruction,
if haply there should suddenly come a blast of the
South Wind or the blustering West Wind, which
oftenest wreck ships in despite of the sovereign
gods? Nay, verily for this time let us yield to black
night and make ready our supper, remaining by the
swift ship, and in the morning we will go aboard,
and put out into the broad sea.'

"So spoke Euryloehus, and the rest of my com-
rades gave assent. Then verily I knew that some
god was assuredly devising ill, and I spoke and
addressed him with winged words:

" ' Euryloehus, verily ye constrain me, who stand
alone. But come now, do ye all swear to me a
mighty oath, to the end that, if we haply find a herd of
kine or a great Hock of sheep, no man may slay either
cow or sheep in the blind folly of his mind ; but
be content to eat the food which immortal Circe
gave.'

THE ODYSSEY, XII. 303-329

" So I spoke, and they straightway swore that
they would not, even as I bade them. But when
they had sworn and made an end of the oath, we
moored our well-built ship in the hollow harbour
near a spring of sweet water, and my comrades went
forth from the ship and skilfully made ready their
supper. But when they had put from them the
desire of food and drink, then they fell to weeping,
as they remembered their dear comrades whom Scylla
had snatched from out the hollow ship and devoured ;
and sweet sleep came upon them as they wept. But
when it was the third watch of the night, and the
stars had turned their course, Zeus, the cloud-
gatherer, roused against us a fierce wind with a won-
drous tempest, and hid with clouds the land and sea
alike, and night rushed down from heaven. And as
soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, we
dragged our ship, and made her fast in a hollow cave,
where were the fair dancing-floors and seats of the
nymphs. Then I called my men together and spoke
among them :

" ' Friends, in our swift ship is meat and drink ;
let us therefore keep our hands from those kine lest
we come to harm, for these are the cows and goodly
sheep of a dread god, even of Helios, who oversees
all things and overhears all things.'

" So I spoke, and their proud hearts consented.
Then for a full month the South Wind blew unceas-
ingly, nor did any other wind arise except the East
and the South.

" Now so long as my men had grain and red wine
they kept their hands from the kine, for they were
eager to save their lives. 1 But when all the stores

1 Some prefer to render " though pining for livelihood";
but the meaning seems fixed by xxiv. 534 f.

had been consumed from out the ship, and now they
must needs roam about in search of game, fishes,
and fowl, and whatever might come to their hands
— fishing with bent hooks, for hunger pinched their
bellies — then I went apart up the island that I might
pray to the gods in the hope that one of them might
show me a way to go. And when, as I went through
the island, I had got away from my comrades, I
washed my hands in a place where there was shelter
from the wind, and prayed to all the gods that hold
Olympus ; but they shed sweet sleep upon my eye-
lids. And meanwhile Eurylochus began to give evil
counsel to my comrades :

" ' Hear my words, comrades, for all your evil
plight. All forms of death are hateful to wretched
mortals, but to die of hunger, and so meet one's
doom, is the most pitiful. Nay, come, let us drive
off the best of the kine of Helios and offer sacrifice
to the immortals who hold broad heaven. And if
we ever reach Ithaca, our native land, we will
straightway build a rich temple to Helios Hyperion
and put therein many goodly offerings. And if haply
he be wroth at all because of his straight-horned
kine, and be minded to destroy our ship, and the
other gods consent, rather would I lose my life once
for all with a gulp at the wave, than pine slowly
away in a desert isle.'

" So spoke Eurylochus, and the rest of my com-
rades gave assent. Straightway they drove off the
best of the kine of Helios from near at hand, for
not far from the dark-prowed ship were grazing the
fair, sleek kine, broad of brow. Around these, then,
they stood and made prayer to the gods, plucking
the tender leaves from off a high -crested oak ; 1 for

1 The green leaves were to serve as a substitute for the
barley grains ordinarily used in sacrifice.

they had no white barley on board the well-benched
ship. Now when they had prayed and had cut the
throats of the kine and flayed them, they cut out
the thigh-pieces and covered them with a double
layer of fat and laid raw flesh upon them. They had
no wine to pour over the blazing sacrifice, but they
made libations with water, and roasted all the entrails
over the fire. Now when the thighs were wholly
burned and they had tasted the inner parts, they
cut up the rest and spitted it. Then it was that
sweet sleep fled from my eyelids, and I went my
way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea. But
when, as I went, I drew near to the curved ship,
then verily the hot savour of the fat was wafted
about me, and I groaned and cried aloud to the
immortal gods :

" ' Father Zeus and ye other blessed gods that are
for ever, verily it was for my ruin that ye lulled me
in pitiless sleep, while my comrades remaining behind
have contrived a monstrous deed.'

"Swiftly then to Helios Hyperion came Lampetie'
of the long robes, bearing tidings that we had slain
his kine ; and straightway he spoke among the im-
mortals, wroth at heart :

" ' Father Zeus and ye other blessed gods that are
for ever, take vengeance now on the comrades of
Odysseus, son of Laertes, who have insolently slain
my kine, in which I ever took delight, when I went
toward the starry heaven and when I turned back
again to earth from heaven. If they do not pay me
fit atonement for the kine I will go down to Hades
and shine among the dead.'

" Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered him and
said : ' Helios, do thou verily shine on among the

a diver he fell from the deck and his proud spirit
left his bones. Therewith Zeus thundered and hurled
his bolt upon the ship, and she quivered from stem
to stern, smitten by the bolt of Zeus, and was rilled
with sulphurous smoke, and my comrades fell from
out the ship. Like sea-crows they were borne on
the waves about the black ship, and the god took
from them their returning. But I kept pacing up
and down the ship till the surge tore the sides from
the keel, and the wave bore her on dismantled and
snapped the mast off at the keel ; but over the mast
had been flung the back-stay fashioned of ox-hide ;
with this I lashed the two together, both keel and
mast, and sitting on these was borne by the direful
winds.

" Then verily the West Wind ceased to blow tem-
pestuously, and swiftly the South Wind came, bringing
sorrow to my heart, that I might traverse again the
way to baneful Charybdis. All night long was I
borne, and at the rising of the sun I came to the
cliff of Scylla and to dread Charybdis. She verily
sucked down the salt water of the sea, but I, spring-
ing up to the tall fig-tree, laid hold of it, and clung
to it like a bat. Yet I could in no wise plant my
feet firmly or climb upon the tree, for its roots spread
far below and its branches hung out of reach above,
long and great, and overshadowed Charybdis. There
I clung steadfastly until she should vomit forth mast
and keel again, and to my joy they came at length.
At the hour when a man rises from the assembly for
his supper, one that decides the many quarrels of
young men that seek judgment, even at that hour
those spars appeared from out Charybdis. And I let

go hands and feet from above and plunged down
into the waters out beyond the long spars, and
sitting on these I rowed onward with my hands.
But as for Scylla, the father of gods and men did
not suffer her again to catch sight of me, else should
I never have escaped utter destruction.

"Thence for nine days was I borne, and on the
tenth night the gods brought me to Ogygia, where
the fair-tressed Calypso dwells, dread goddess ot
human speech, who gave me welcome and tendance.
But why should I tell thee this tale ? For it was
but yesterday that I told it in thy hall to thyself and
to thy noble wife. It is an irksome thing, meseems,
to tell again a plain-told tale."
